Look no further than medium length hairstyles with bangs! This versatile style is perfect for adding a touch of effortless chic to your everyday look. In this article, we will explore different ways to style medium length hair with bangs for oval faces, and share some tips and tricks for maintaining healthy hair.</p><h2>What is an Oval Face Shape?</h2><p>Before we delve into the best medium length hairstyles with bangs for oval faces, let's first define what an oval face shape is. An oval face shape is characterized by a forehead that is slightly wider than the chin, with prominent cheekbones and a gently curved jawline. This face shape is considered to be the most versatile, as it can pull off a variety of hairstyles.</p><h2>How to Determine Your Face Shape?</h2><p>If you're not sure whether you have an oval face shape, here's a quick way to determine your face shape:</p><ol><li>Stand in front of a mirror and pull your hair back.</li><li>Trace the outline of your face with a washable marker or lipstick.</li><li>Compare the shape of your face to the following face shape descriptions:</li></ol><p>If your face is wider at the forehead and tapers down to a narrow chin, you have a heart-shaped face. If your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all roughly the same width, you have a square face. If your forehead and jawline are both narrow, with prominent cheekbones, you have a diamond-shaped face. And if your face is widest at the cheekbones and tapers down to a narrow forehead and chin, you have an oval face!</p><h2>Medium Length Hairstyles with Bangs for Oval Faces</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, let's explore some of the best medium length hairstyles with bangs that will flatter your oval face:</p><h3>1. Long Bob with Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>The long bob, or "lob," is a classic hairstyle that is both chic and low-maintenance. For oval faces, we recommend adding side-swept bangs to soften the face and draw attention to the eyes.</p><h3>2. Layered Mid-Length Hair with Curtain Bangs</h3><p>If you prefer a more bohemian look, try a layered mid-length hairstyle with curtain bangs. This style features long, wispy bangs that frame the face and add texture to the hair.</p><h3>3. Wavy Shoulder-Length Hair with Blunt Bangs</h3><p>If you have naturally wavy hair, consider a shoulder-length hairstyle with blunt bangs. This style is perfect for adding volume and texture to the hair, while the blunt bangs add a touch of edge to the look.</p><h3>4. Textured Shag with Wispy Bangs</h3><p>The shag haircut has made a comeback in recent years, and for good reason. This hairstyle features choppy layers and a textured, tousled look that is perfect for adding volume to fine hair. For oval faces, we recommend adding wispy bangs to the style to soften the face and add a touch of femininity.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Healthy Hair</h2><p>No matter which medium length hairstyle with bangs you choose, it's important to take good care of your hair to keep it looking healthy and lustrous. Here are some tips for maintaining healthy hair:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every 2-3 days to avoid stripping it of its natural oils.</li><li>Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid drying out your hair.</li><li>Avoid using heat-styling tools on a daily basis.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using heat-styling tools.</li><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote healthy hair growth.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What is the best medium length hairstyle for an oval face?</h3><p>The best medium length hairstyle for an oval face is one that adds volume and texture to the hair, while flattering the face shape.
