In this article, we'll cover some tips and tricks on what to do with blow dried hair. Whether you want to add some volume, create a sleek style, or simply maintain your blowout for longer, we've got you covered.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#section1">How to Add Volume to Blow Dried Hair</a></li><li><a href="#section2">How to Create a Sleek Style with Blow Dried Hair</a></li><li><a href="#section3">How to Maintain Your Blowout</a></li><li><a href="#section4">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#section5">Hair Care Tips for Blow Dried Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="section1">How to Add Volume to Blow Dried Hair</h2><p>If you want to add some volume to your blow dried hair, there are a few different techniques you can try.</p><h3>1. Use a Round Brush</h3><p>Using a round brush while blow drying your hair can help add volume and shape to your strands. Start by sectioning your hair and working with one section at a time. Place the round brush under the hair at the roots and pull it upward while blowing hot air onto the hair. Repeat this process until the section is dry, then move on to the next section.</p><h3>2. Flip Your Hair Upside Down</h3><p>If you're short on time, flipping your hair upside down and blow drying it can help add volume and texture. Start by bending over at the waist and blow drying your hair from the roots to the ends. Once your hair is dry, flip it back over and style as desired.</p><h2 id="section2">How to Create a Sleek Style with Blow Dried Hair</h2><p>If you want to create a sleek and polished look with your blow dried hair, there are a few different techniques you can try.</p><h3>1. Use a Flat Iron</h3><p>Using a flat iron on your blow dried hair can help create a smooth and straight look. Start by sectioning your hair and working with one section at a time. Place the flat iron at the roots of the section and slowly glide it down to the ends. Repeat this process until the entire section is straightened, then move on to the next section.</p><h3>2. Use a Smoothing Serum</h3><p>Applying a smoothing serum to your blow dried hair can help tame frizz and create a sleek look. Start by applying a small amount of serum to your hands, then run your hands through your hair, concentrating on the ends. Be careful not to apply too much product, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</p><h2 id="section3">How to Maintain Your Blowout</h2><p>If you want to maintain your blowout for longer, there are a few different techniques you can try.</p><h3>1. Sleep with Your Hair in a Bun</h3><p>One way to maintain your blowout overnight is to sleep with your hair in a bun. Start by pulling your hair into a high ponytail, then twist the ponytail around itself to create a bun. Secure the bun with bobby pins, then wrap a silk scarf around your head to protect your hair while you sleep.</p><h3>2. Use Dry Shampoo</h3><p>Using dry shampoo on your roots can help absorb excess oil and keep your hair looking fresh. Start by spraying a small amount of dry shampoo onto your roots, then use your fingers to massage it in. Be sure to brush through your hair afterwards to distribute the product evenly.</p><h2 id="section4">FAQs</h2><h3>1. How often should I blow dry my hair?</h3><p>Blow drying your hair too often can cause damage and breakage. It's best to limit your blowouts to once or twice a week, and allow your hair to air dry the rest of the time.</p><h3>2. Can blow drying cause hair loss?</h3><p>Blow drying your hair can cause some damage, but it's unlikely to cause hair loss unless you're using extremely high heat or pulling on your hair too hard.</p><h2 id="section5">Hair Care Tips for Blow Dried Hair</h2><p>If you want to keep your blow dried hair looking healthy and shiny, there are a few hair care tips you should follow.</p><h3>1. Use a Heat Protectant</h3><p>Using a heat protectant spray on your hair before blow drying can help minimize damage and keep your hair looking healthy. Be sure to apply the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends.</p><h3>2. Don't Overdo It with Products</h3><p>Using too many hair care products can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy. Stick to one or two products at most, and be sure to apply them sparingly.</p><p>Whether you're looking to add volume, create a sleek style, or maintain your blowout, there are plenty of tips and tricks you can try. By following these guidelines and taking good care of your hair, you can keep your blow dried locks looking healthy and beautiful.</p></article>
