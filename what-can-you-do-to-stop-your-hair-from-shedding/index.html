Here are some tips to help you get started:</p><h3>1. Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>A balanced diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals is essential for healthy hair. Make sure you're getting enough protein, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are all important for hair growth and strength.</p><h3>2. Manage Stress</h3><p>Stress can take a toll on your hair, so it's important to find ways to manage it. This might include practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga, or simply taking time each day to do something you enjoy.</p><h3>3.

Try to limit your use of heat tools and opt for looser hairstyles that don't pull on your hair.</p><h3>4.
