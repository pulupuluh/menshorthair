Shoulder length hair with bangs is also easy to maintain and style, making it a popular choice for busy people.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Style Shoulder Length Hair with Bangs</h2><p>There are many different ways to style shoulder length hair with bangs, depending on your personal taste and the occasion. Here are some popular options:</p><h3>1. Straight and Sleek</h3><p>To achieve a straight and sleek look, blow dry your hair straight with a round brush, then use a straightening iron to smooth out any kinks. Finish with a shine serum or hairspray for a polished finish.</p><h3>2. Beachy Waves</h3><p>For a more relaxed look, create beachy waves with a curling iron or sea salt spray. Scrunch your hair with your fingers to create volume and texture, then finish with a texturizing spray.</p><h3>3. Half-Up, Half-Down</h3><p>For a cute and casual look, try a half-up, half-down hairstyle. Simply pull the top half of your hair back into a ponytail or bun, leaving the rest of your hair down. This style works well with straight or wavy hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to style shoulder length hair with bangs:</p><h3>1.

Work in small sections and clamp the iron down firmly, pulling it through your hair from root to tip.</p><h3>5. Add Volume</h3><p>To add volume to your hair, use a volumizing mousse or spray at the roots. Tease your hair gently with a comb to create lift and texture.</p><h3>6. Style Your Bangs</h3><p>If you have bangs, use a round brush to blow dry them straight. Use a flat iron to smooth out any kinks or curls, then style them to the side or straight down.</p><h3>7.
