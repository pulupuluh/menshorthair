Hair goes through three phases: anagen (growth), catagen (transition), and telogen (resting). During the telogen phase, hair falls out naturally and is replaced by new hair.</p><p>Balding, on the other hand, is a progressive hair loss condition that results in permanent hair loss. It can be caused by genetics, hormones, medications, or other factors.</p><h3>How to Tell the Difference</h3><p>The easiest way to tell the difference between shedding and balding is to look at the amount of hair you're losing. If you're shedding, you'll notice a few hairs falling out throughout the day, but it won't be enough to cause any noticeable thinning. If you're balding, you'll notice a significant amount of hair loss, particularly on the top of your head.</p><p>You can also look at the quality of the hair you're losing. Shedding hair will be long and have a white bulb at the end, indicating that it fell out naturally. Balding hair, on the other hand, will be shorter and thinner, with no bulb at the end.</p><h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms of Shedding and Balding</h2><p>Both shedding and balding can present with similar symptoms, such as:</p><ul><li>Increased hair loss during showering or brushing</li><li>Thinning hair on the top of the head</li><li>Receding hairline</li><li>Bald spots on the scalp</li></ul><p>However, there are some differences in the symptoms of shedding and balding.
