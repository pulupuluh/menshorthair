Here are some tips for styling box braids with thin edges:</p><h3>1. Avoid Tight Styles</h3><p>Tight braids can pull on your hairline and cause further damage. Instead, opt for looser styles that won't put too much pressure on your edges. You can try a half-up, half-down style or a loose bun.</p><h3>2. Use Edge Control</h3><p>Edge control can help smooth down your edges and give your style a polished look. Make sure to use a product that won't cause buildup or flaking, as this can further damage your hairline.</p><h3>3.
