Look no further! In this article, we will provide you with a comprehensive guide on the best shampoo for fine curly hair in 2020. We will cover everything from descriptions of the top shampoos, to how to use them, tips, frequently asked questions, and hair care advice.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The following shampoos are the best for fine curly hair in 2020:</p><h3>1. DevaCurl No-Poo Original Zero Lather Conditioning Cleanser</h3><p>This shampoo is perfect for those with curly hair who want to avoid harsh lathering agents. It cleanses the scalp and hair without stripping it of natural oils, leaving hair soft, manageable, and frizz-free.</p><h3>2. Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo</h3><p>This shampoo is made with natural ingredients like coconut oil and hibiscus flower extract to moisturize and detangle hair, while also enhancing its natural shine. It's perfect for those with fine curly hair who want to achieve a healthy, bouncy look.</p><h3>3. Ouidad Curl Quencher Moisturizing Shampoo</h3><p>This shampoo is specifically designed for those with fine, tight curls. It's infused with grapeseed oil and wheat protein to provide long-lasting hydration and strengthen hair from the inside out.</p><h2>How to Use</h2><p>When using these shampoos, it's important to keep a few things in mind:</p><h3>1. Wet hair thoroughly</h3><p>Before applying shampoo, make sure your hair is completely wet. This will help distribute the product evenly and prevent tangling.</p><h3>2. Apply shampoo to scalp</h3><p>Focus on applying shampoo to your scalp rather than your hair. This will help remove any buildup or dirt that may be weighing down your curls.</p><h3>3. Massage gently</h3><p>Massage the shampoo into your scalp gently, using your fingertips. This will help stimulate blood flow and promote healthy hair growth.</p><h3>4. Rinse thoroughly</h3><p>Make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly with warm water. This will help remove any remaining shampoo and prevent buildup.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>To get the most out of your shampoo, try these tips:</p><h3>1. Use a wide-tooth comb</h3><p>After shampooing, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. This will help prevent breakage and keep your curls looking their best.</p><h3>2. Don't overwash</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of natural oils, leaving it dry and brittle. Try to limit shampooing to once or twice a week, depending on your hair type and lifestyle.</p><h3>3. Deep condition regularly</h3><p>To keep your curls hydrated and healthy, use a deep conditioner once a week. This will help restore moisture and prevent damage.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some common questions about the best shampoo for fine curly hair:</p><h3>1. Can I use regular shampoo on my curly hair?</h3><p>While it's possible to use regular shampoo on curly hair, it's not recommended. Regular shampoos often contain harsh sulfates that can strip hair of natural oils and leave it dry and frizzy.</p><h3>2. Can I use conditioner instead of shampoo?</h3><p>While conditioner can help moisturize hair, it's not a substitute for shampoo. Shampoo is designed to cleanse the scalp and remove buildup, while conditioner is meant to soften and detangle hair.</p><h3>3. How often should I shampoo my curly hair?</h3><p>This depends on your hair type and lifestyle. If you have fine curly hair, you may only need to shampoo once or twice a week. If you have thicker, coarser curls, you may need to shampoo more frequently.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>In addition to using the best shampoo for fine curly hair, it's important to take care of your curls in other ways:</p><h3>1. Avoid heat styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can damage hair and cause it to become dry and brittle. Try to limit heat styling as much as possible, or use a heat protectant spray.</p><h3>2. Trim regularly</h3><p>Regular trims can help prevent split ends and keep your curls looking healthy and bouncy.</p><h3>3. Protect hair while sleeping</h3><p>Invest in a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent hair from becoming tangled and frizzy while you sleep.</p><p>Now that you have a better understanding of the best shampoo for fine curly hair in 2020, as well as tips and hair care advice, you can achieve the healthy, bouncy curls you've always wanted!</p></article>
