Short layers can add volume and texture to your hair, but they can also be tricky to style. In this article, we'll give you some tips and tricks for styling short layers on medium hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Medium length hair with short layers is a popular hairstyle that can be versatile and easy to maintain. Short layers can add movement and texture to your hair, making it look fuller and more voluminous. However, styling short layers can be challenging, especially if you're not sure how to make the most of them.</p><h2>How to Style Short Layers on Medium Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips and tricks for styling short layers on medium hair:</p><h3>1. Blow-dry your hair upside down</h3><p>One of the best ways to add volume to your short layers is to blow-dry your hair upside down. This will help lift your hair at the roots and create more volume and texture. Use a round brush to smooth out your hair as you blow-dry it, and finish with a blast of cool air to set your style.</p><h3>2. Use a volumizing mousse</h3><p>If you want to add even more volume to your short layers, use a volumizing mousse before you blow-dry your hair. Apply the mousse to your roots and work it through your hair with your fingers. This will help create more lift and texture, making your short layers look fuller and more voluminous.</p><h3>3. Try a messy bun</h3><p>A messy bun is a great way to style your short layers on medium hair. Gather your hair into a high ponytail, leaving out your short layers. Twist your hair into a bun and secure it with bobby pins. Then, use your fingers to pull out some pieces of hair around your face and your short layers. This will create a messy, textured look that's perfect for casual occasions.</p><h3>4. Use a texture spray</h3><p>A texture spray can help add definition and texture to your short layers. Spray the texture spray onto your hair and use your fingers to work it through your layers. This will help create a tousled, beachy look that's perfect for summer.</p><h3>5. Try a half-up hairstyle</h3><p>A half-up hairstyle is a great way to show off your short layers while still keeping your hair out of your face. Gather the top half of your hair, leaving out your short layers, and secure it with a hair tie or clip. Then, use a curling iron to curl your short layers and the rest of your hair. This will create a soft, romantic look that's perfect for special occasions.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to styling short layers on medium hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and condition your hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. This will help create more volume and texture in your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a volumizing mousse</h3><p>Apply a volumizing mousse to your roots and work it through your hair with your fingers.

Finish with a blast of cool air to set your style.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a texture spray</h3><p>Spray a texture spray onto your hair and use your fingers to work it through your layers.

Then, use a curling iron to curl your short layers and the rest of your hair.
