If you must use these tools, be sure to use a heat protectant spray and limit their use as much as possible. </p><h3>Be Gentle with Your Hair</h3><p>Brushing or combing your hair too vigorously can cause breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb or a brush with soft bristles, and be gentle when detangling your hair.</p><h3>Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Tight hairstyles like braids, ponytails, or buns can pull on your hair and cause breakage. If you must wear your hair in these styles, be sure to loosen them up and give your hair a break from time to time.</p><h3>Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Regular trims can help prevent split ends, which can lead to hair breakage. Aim to get a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep your hair healthy.</p><h3>Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>A balanced diet rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals can help keep your hair healthy and prevent breakage.
