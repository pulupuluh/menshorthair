It can also be caused by excessive use of heat styling tools, over-washing, and using harsh hair products. Frizz occurs when the hair cuticle is raised, causing the hair to look rough and tangled. Dry hair is dull, brittle, and prone to breakage. </p><p>If you have frizz and dry hair, you may feel frustrated and embarrassed about your hair. But there are many ways to get rid of frizz and dry hair naturally. </p><h2 id="howto">How to Get Rid of Frizz and Dry Hair</h2><p>The first step to getting rid of frizz and dry hair is to identify the cause of the problem.

Once you know the cause, you can take the appropriate steps to treat it. </p><p>Here are some effective ways to get rid of frizz and dry hair:</p><h3>1. Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Choose a shampoo and conditioner that is specifically designed for dry and frizzy hair. Look for products that contain natural oils such as coconut oil, argan oil, and jojoba oil. These oils can help to moisturize and nourish your hair, leaving it soft and shiny. </p><h3>2. Apply a hair mask</h3><p>Once a week, apply a hair mask to your hair to help nourish and repair it.

If you must use heat styling tools, use them sparingly and always use a heat protectant spray. </p><h3>4. Don't over-wash your hair</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, leaving it dry and frizzy. Try to wash your hair every other day or every two days. </p><h3>5.
