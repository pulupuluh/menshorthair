This style is often called the "short sides long top" haircut and it's a popular choice for men of all ages.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The short sides long top haircut is a type of fade haircut that involves cutting the hair on the sides and back of the head short while leaving the hair on top longer. This creates a contrast between the short sides and the long top that can be styled in many different ways. This haircut is often paired with a disconnected undercut, which means that the hair on top is disconnected from the sides and back.</p><h2>How to Cut Hair Short Sides Long Top</h2><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Clippers</h3><p>The first step to cutting hair short sides long top is to choose the right clippers. You'll need a set of clippers with different guard sizes so that you can create a fade effect on the sides and back of the head. A good set of clippers will make the process much easier and will give you better results.</p><h3>Step 2: Start with the Sides</h3><p>The next step is to start cutting the hair on the sides and back of the head. Begin with the longest guard size and work your way down to the shortest size. Make sure to blend the hair so that there are no harsh lines between the different guard sizes. You can use a comb to help guide the clippers and create a smooth transition between the different lengths.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Top</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting the sides and back of the head, it's time to move on to the top. Use scissors to cut the hair on top to the desired length. You can leave it longer or shorter depending on your preference. Remember that the hair on top should be disconnected from the sides and back, so don't blend it into the shorter hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Style the Hair</h3><p>Finally, it's time to style the hair. You can use a variety of products such as pomade, wax, or gel to create different styles. You can slick the hair back, comb it to the side, or leave it messy and textured. The possibilities are endless!</p><h2>Tips for Cutting Hair Short Sides Long Top</h2><ul><li>Start with a longer guard size and work your way down gradually</li><li>Take your time and don't rush the process</li><li>Use a comb to help guide the clippers and create a smooth transition</li><li>Use scissors to cut the hair on top to the desired length</li><li>Experiment with different styling products to find the right one for you</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Is the short sides long top haircut suitable for all hair types?</h3><p>Yes, this haircut can be adapted to suit all hair types.
