One of the most iconic aspects of the era was the hairstyles, which ranged from the bouffant to the pixie cut. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the popular 1960 hairstyle trends and how you can recreate them in 2023.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 1960s was a time of experimentation and revolution in the world of hair. Women were no longer content with simple, conservative styles and began to embrace more daring looks. The bouffant, beehive, and pixie cut were just a few of the popular hairstyles of the era. Men also had their own unique hairstyles, including the slicked-back look and the iconic Beatles mop top. These hairstyles were often complemented by bold, vibrant colors and accessorized with headbands, scarves, and bows.</p><h2>How to Recreate 1960 Hairstyles</h2><p>If you're looking to add a touch of retro style to your hair, here are some tips for recreating popular 1960s hairstyles:</p><h3>Bouffant</h3><p>The bouffant was a popular hairstyle for women in the 1960s, characterized by a high, rounded shape at the crown of the head. To create this look, start by teasing the hair at the crown of your head to create volume. Then, smooth the top layer of hair over the teased area and secure with bobby pins. Finally, use a curling iron to add loose curls to the ends of your hair.</p><h3>Beehive</h3><p>The beehive was another iconic hairstyle of the 1960s, characterized by a high, cone-shaped style. To create this look, start by backcombing the hair at the crown of your head to create volume. Then, smooth the top layer of hair over the teased area and secure with bobby pins. Finally, use hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>The pixie cut was a popular short hairstyle for women in the 1960s, featuring short, choppy layers. To create this look, start by cutting your hair into short layers, focusing on the crown and sides of your head. Then, use a styling wax or pomade to add texture and shape to your hair.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to recreating the bouffant hairstyle:</p><ol><li>Tease the hair at the crown of your head to create volume.</li><li>Smooth the top layer of hair over the teased area and secure with bobby pins.</li><li>Use a curling iron to add loose curls to the ends of your hair.</li><li>Finish with hairspray to hold the style in place.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Success</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect 1960s hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Use a volumizing mousse or spray to add body to your hair.</li><li>Invest in a good quality hairspray to keep your style in place.</li><li>If you're struggling to create the perfect bouffant or beehive, consider using hair extensions to add volume.</li><li>Accessorize your style with a headband, scarf, or bow for an authentic 1960s look.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What was the most popular hairstyle of the 1960s?</h3><p>The bouffant was arguably the most popular hairstyle of the 1960s, made famous by celebrities such as Jackie Kennedy and Brigitte Bardot.</p><h3>What products were used to style hair in the 1960s?</h3><p>Hairspray, mousse, and gel were all popular hair styling products in the 1960s.</p><h3>Can men recreate 1960s hairstyles?</h3><p>Yes, men can recreate 1960s hairstyles such as the slicked-back look and the Beatles mop top.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips</h2><p>When recreating 1960s hairstyles, it's important to take care of your hair.
