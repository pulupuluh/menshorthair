Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather the Right Tools</h3><p>Before you start trimming your hair, make sure you have the right tools. You will need sharp scissors, a comb, and hair clips to section your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and drying it thoroughly. This will make it easier to cut and give you a more accurate result.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Using the comb, divide your hair into sections. Start by parting your hair down the middle, then divide it into two sections.

Take a small section of hair from the back of your head and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut off the desired length. Make sure to cut the hair in a straight line.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Top Layer</h3><p>Once you have cut the bottom layer, release the top layer of your hair. Comb it straight down and cut off the desired length. Make sure to cut the hair at an angle to create layers.</p><h3>Step 6: Blend the Layers</h3><p>Using the scissors, blend the layers together by cutting into the hair at an angle.
