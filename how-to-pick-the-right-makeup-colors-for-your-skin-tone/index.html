This can be done by looking at the veins on the inside of your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone. If they appear green, you have a warm skin tone. If you can’t tell whether your veins appear blue or green, you have a neutral skin tone.</p><h2 id="cool-tones">Makeup Colors for Cool Skin Tones</h2><p>If you have a cool skin tone, you should look for makeup colors that have blue or pink undertones. Some good choices include:</p><ul><li>Foundation: Choose a shade with a pink or neutral undertone.</li><li>Blush: Look for shades of pink, rose, and mauve.</li><li>Lipstick: Choose shades of pink, berry, and red.</li><li>Eyeshadow: Look for shades of blue, purple, and gray.</li></ul><h2 id="warm-tones">Makeup Colors for Warm Skin Tones</h2><p>If you have a warm skin tone, you should look for makeup colors that have yellow or golden undertones.
