This style is all about shaved sides and back, with longer hair on top. It's a great way to show off your personality and individuality, and it's perfect for those who want a low-maintenance haircut. In this article, we'll show you how to cut an undercut pixie in relaxed English language, step-by-step.</p><h2>Description: What is an Undercut Pixie?</h2><p>An undercut pixie is a type of haircut that features short hair on the sides and back, with longer hair on top. The sides and back are usually shaved or cut very short, while the top is left longer and can be styled in a variety of ways. This style is popular among women who want a bold and edgy look, and it's also a great choice for those who want a low-maintenance hairstyle.</p><h2>How to Cut an Undercut Pixie: Step-by-Step Guide</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting, you'll need to gather your tools. You'll need a pair of clippers, a comb, hairdressing scissors, and hair clips.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into four parts: top, sides, back, and nape. Use hair clips to secure each section.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Sides and Back</h3><p>Using your clippers, start cutting the sides and back of your hair. Use a shorter guard to create a close shave, or leave a bit more length if you prefer. Be sure to blend the sides and back into the top for a seamless look.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Nape</h3><p>Next, use your clippers to cut the hair at the nape of your neck. This area should be cut short, but not shaved.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Top</h3><p>Using your scissors, start cutting the hair on the top of your head. This area should be left longer than the sides and back, so be sure to cut it to the desired length. You can also add layers or texture to the top for a more dynamic look.</p><h3>Step 6: Blend the Top and Sides</h3><p>Use your scissors to blend the top and sides of your hair. This will create a seamless transition between the longer hair on top and the shorter hair on the sides and back.</p><h3>Step 7: Style as Desired</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, style it as desired. You can add texture, volume, or sleekness depending on your personal preference.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting an Undercut Pixie</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting an undercut pixie:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer length and work your way shorter. You can always cut more hair, but you can't add it back once it's gone.</li><li>Use a mirror to check your progress as you cut.</li><li>Be patient and take your time. Cutting hair can be tricky, so don't rush the process.</li><li>If you're not confident in your cutting skills, consider going to a professional stylist.</li></ul><h2>FAQs About Undercut Pixie Haircuts</h2><h3>1.
