Depending on your hair type and desired look, you may want to use mousse, gel, or a texturizing spray.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a blow dryer, dry your hair in sections, using a round brush to add volume and shape. Be sure to use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a styling tool such as a curling iron or straightener to achieve your desired look.
