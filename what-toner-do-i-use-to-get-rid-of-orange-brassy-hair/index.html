Don't worry, you're not alone! Many people struggle with this issue, but there's a solution - toner.

It works by neutralizing the warm tones in the hair, leaving you with a cooler, more natural-looking shade. Toners come in different colors, with purple being the most popular for eliminating yellow tones, and blue for orange tones. </p><p>There are different types of toners available, including demi-permanent and permanent toners. Demi-permanent toners are less damaging and can last up to 6-8 weeks, while permanent toners last longer but can be more damaging to the hair. </p><h2 id="how-to-use-toner">How to Use Toner</h2><p>Before using toner, it's important to have your hair lightened to the desired level. Toner can't lighten your hair, but it can help tone down brassy or yellow tones. Once your hair is lightened, you can apply toner using a bowl and brush, or an applicator bottle. </p><p>Most toners have instructions on the packaging, but generally, you'll need to mix the toner with a developer in a 1:2 ratio (1 part toner to 2 parts developer). Apply the toner to your hair, starting from the roots and working your way down to the ends. Leave the toner on for the recommended time, usually around 15-30 minutes, then rinse it off with cool water. </p><h2 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use toner to get rid of orange brassy hair:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup.</li><li>Towel-dry your hair and put on gloves.</li><li>Mix the toner with a developer in a 1:2 ratio.</li><li>Apply the toner to your hair, starting from the roots and working your way down to the ends.</li><li>Leave the toner on for the recommended time, usually around 15-30 minutes.</li><li>Rinse the toner off with cool water.</li><li>Apply a deep conditioner to your hair and leave it on for 5-10 minutes.</li><li>Rinse off the conditioner with cool water.</li><li>Style your hair as desired.</li></ol><h2 id="tips-for-using-toner">Tips for Using Toner</h2><p>Here are some tips for using toner:</p><ul><li>Choose the right toner for your hair color - purple for yellow tones, and blue for orange tones.</li><li>Don't leave the toner on for too long, or it can turn your hair purple or blue.</li><li>If you're using a permanent toner, make sure to use a lower volume developer to avoid damaging your hair.</li><li>Use a toning shampoo and conditioner to maintain your color and keep brassy tones at bay.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair too often, as it can strip the toner and cause your color to fade faster.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about toner:</p><h3>How often should I use toner?</h3><p>It depends on how often you wash your hair and how quickly your hair fades. Generally, toner can last up to 6-8 weeks, but you may need to touch up your color every 4-6 weeks.</p><h3>Can toner damage my hair?</h3><p>Toner is less damaging than bleach, but it can still cause damage if used too frequently or with a high volume developer. Make sure to follow the instructions on the packaging and use a lower volume developer for permanent toners.</p><h3>Can I use toner on natural hair?</h3><p>Toner is designed for use on lightened hair, so it won't work on natural hair. If you want to tone down brassy tones in your natural hair, try using a purple or blue shampoo instead.</p><h2 id="hair-care-after-toning">Hair Care After Toning</h2><p>After toning your hair, it's important to take care of it to maintain your color and keep your hair healthy. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as they can damage your hair and cause your color to fade.</li><li>Use a hair mask once a week to nourish and hydrate your hair.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV-protectant spray.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and using the right toner, you can get rid of orange brassy hair and achieve the perfect shade you've always wanted.</p></article>
