Muslims are encouraged to take care of their hair and keep it neat and clean. In fact, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: "Cleanliness is half of faith" (Sahih Muslim).</p><p>Therefore, hair care is an important aspect of Islamic hygiene, and there are specific guidelines that Muslims should follow when it comes to cutting and grooming their hair.</p><h2 id="when">When not to cut hair in Islam</h2><p>There are certain times when Muslims are prohibited from cutting their hair. These include:</p><h3>During the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah</h3><p>The first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are considered the most sacred days in the Islamic calendar, and cutting hair during this period is not allowed. This is because these days are associated with the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, and Muslims who are not performing the pilgrimage are encouraged to observe the sacredness of this time.</p><h3>On the day of Eid al-Adha</h3><p>Eid al-Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, is one of the two major festivals in Islam. It is celebrated on the 10th day of Dhul-Hijjah, and Muslims are prohibited from cutting their hair on this day.</p><h3>During menstruation</h3><p>Women who are menstruating are also prohibited from cutting their hair, as well as performing certain other acts of worship, such as praying or fasting. This is because menstruation is considered a period of impurity in Islam, and Muslims are encouraged to avoid certain activities during this time.</p><p>It is important to note that these prohibitions only apply to cutting hair. Trimming or grooming hair is generally allowed, as long as it does not involve cutting the hair to a significant length.</p><h2 id="how">How to take care of your hair</h2><p>Now that we know when not to cut hair in Islam, let's take a look at some general tips for hair care:</p><h3>Wash your hair regularly</h3><p>Keeping your hair clean is an important aspect of hair care.

Additionally, it is recommended to wash your hair at least once a week.</p><h3>Use natural products</h3><p>Using natural hair care products, such as oils and herbs, can help keep your hair healthy and strong. Some popular natural hair care products in Islam include black seed oil, olive oil, and henna.</p><h3>Avoid using heat tools</h3><p>Excessive use of heat tools, such as hair dryers and straighteners, can damage your hair and make it more prone to breakage.
