While some guys embrace their curls, others prefer a sleek, straight look. Whatever your preference may be, there are plenty of ways to make curly hair straight. In this article, we'll go over some tips and tricks to help you achieve the straight look you're going for. </p><h2> How to </h2><p> There are several ways to make curly hair straight.

Then, towel dry your hair and apply a heat protectant spray. Next, use a round brush and blow dryer to straighten your hair. Make sure to use the nozzle attachment on your blow dryer to direct the heat where you want it to go. </p><h3> Flat Iron </h3><p> Another popular method for straightening curly hair is to use a flat iron. First, wash and condition your hair. Then, apply a heat protectant spray. Next, section your hair and use the flat iron to straighten each section. Make sure to use a low heat setting to avoid damaging your hair. </p><h3> Chemical Straightening </h3><p> If you're looking for a more permanent solution to straighten your hair, you may want to consider chemical straightening. This process involves applying a chemical solution to your hair that breaks down the bonds that give your hair its curl. While this method can be effective, it can also be damaging to your hair if not done properly. </p><h2> Step by Step </h2><p> Here's a step-by-step guide to making curly hair straight: </p><h3> 1.
