It affects both men and women and is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. Hair loss can occur gradually over time or rapidly, depending on the individual.</p><h2 id="causes">What Causes Genetic Hair Loss?</h2><p>Genetic hair loss is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. It is believed that the condition is inherited from one or both parents. In men, testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can damage hair follicles and cause hair loss. In women, hormonal imbalances can also contribute to hair loss.</p><h2 id="symptoms">What are the Symptoms of Genetic Hair Loss?</h2><p>The symptoms of genetic hair loss vary depending on the individual. In men, hair loss typically occurs in a pattern that starts at the temples and crown of the head and gradually spreads. Women may experience thinning hair all over the scalp, but the hairline usually remains intact. Both men and women may notice a decrease in hair thickness and volume over time.</p><h2 id="diagnosis">How is Genetic Hair Loss Diagnosed?</h2><p>Genetic hair loss can be diagnosed by a dermatologist or hair specialist. The doctor will examine the scalp and hair to determine the extent of the hair loss and rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms. A biopsy of the scalp may also be performed to determine the underlying cause of the hair loss.</p><h2 id="treatments">What are the Treatments for Genetic Hair Loss?</h2><p>There are several treatments available for genetic hair loss, including medications, hair transplants, and low-level laser therapy. Medications such as minoxidil and finasteride can help slow down hair loss and promote hair growth. Hair transplants involve taking hair from one area of the scalp and transplanting it to the balding area. Low-level laser therapy uses light energy to stimulate hair growth.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Preventing and Managing Genetic Hair Loss</h2><p>There are several things that can be done to prevent and manage genetic hair loss.
