It involves cutting the hair on the sides very short, while leaving the hair on top longer. The hair on top is then styled into a mohawk. Here's how you can cut a mohawk fade on black hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>You'll need a few basic tools to cut a mohawk fade, including:</p><ul><li>Clippers</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Hair spray or gel</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>The first step is to section off the hair on top of your head. Use a comb to create a straight line from the front of your head to the back, separating the hair on top from the hair on the sides. </p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Sides</h3><p>Next, use clippers to cut the hair on the sides of your head very short. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one if you need to.

Use scissors to cut the hair to your desired length, keeping in mind that you'll be styling it into a mohawk. </p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Finally, style your hair into a mohawk. Apply hair spray or gel to keep it in place.
