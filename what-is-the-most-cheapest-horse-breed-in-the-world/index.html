Provide Adequate Shelter</h3><p>Your horse should have access to a shelter that protects them from the elements, such as a barn or run-in shed.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Are cheap horses low quality?</h3><p>A: Not necessarily. While some cheap horses may have health or behavioral issues, many are perfectly healthy and well-behaved.</p><h3>Q: Can I train a cheap horse?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can train a cheap horse just like any other horse.
