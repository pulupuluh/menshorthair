Here are the things you'll need:</p><ul><li>A comb or brush</li><li>A hair dryer</li><li>A styling product, such as pomade, wax, or gel</li></ul><p>Now, let's get started!</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a good quality shampoo and conditioner. This will remove any buildup and make your hair easier to style. Rinse thoroughly and towel dry.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Take a small amount of your chosen styling product and rub it between your palms to warm it up. Apply it evenly through your hair, starting from the back and working your way forward. Make sure to distribute the product evenly to avoid clumps or greasy spots.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a hair dryer to dry your hair while combing it backwards with a comb or brush. This will help to set the style and create the slicked back look. Be sure to use the cool setting on your hair dryer to avoid damaging your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Comb Your Hair Back</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a comb or brush to slick it back. Start at the crown of your head and work your way down to the nape of your neck. Use a firm hand and make sure to comb your hair in the direction you want it to go.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>To set your style and make it last all day, finish with a light mist of hairspray. Hold the can about 10 inches away from your head and spray evenly over your hair.
