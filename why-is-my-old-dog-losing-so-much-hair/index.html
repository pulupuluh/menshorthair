Here are some of the most common causes:</p><h3>1. Age</h3><p>As dogs get older, their bodies go through a lot of changes. One of these changes is a decrease in the production of hormones that keep their coat healthy and thick. This can result in hair loss.</p><h3>2. Allergies</h3><p>Old dogs can develop allergies just like humans. These allergies can be caused by a variety of things, including food, pollen, and dust. Allergies can cause your dog to scratch and chew at their skin, resulting in hair loss.</p><h3>3. Infections</h3><p>Infections, such as ringworm and mange, can cause hair loss in dogs. These infections are often accompanied by other symptoms, such as itching and redness.</p><h3>4. Stress</h3><p>Stress can cause hair loss in dogs just like it can in humans. If your old dog has experienced a change in their environment or routine, it can cause them to become stressed and lose hair.</p><h3>5.
