However, with the right knowledge and techniques, you can find a hairstyle that flatters your face shape and accentuates your features. In this guide, we will discuss the best hairstyles for round fat faces, how to achieve them, and how to maintain them.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A round and fat face usually has a soft and circular shape with full cheeks and a rounded chin. The goal of finding the right hairstyle is to create the illusion of a longer and more angular face shape. This can be achieved by adding volume to the crown and length to the sides and front. A good hairstyle for a round and fat face should also draw attention away from the cheeks and chin.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>When choosing a hairstyle, consider your hair type, face shape, and lifestyle. Discuss your options with your hairstylist and ask for their opinion. They can recommend a hairstyle that suits your face shape and flatters your features. Here are some popular hairstyles for round fat faces:</p><h3>1. Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers can create the illusion of a longer face shape by adding volume and movement to the hair. Layers that start at the cheekbones and flow downwards can elongate the jawline and slim down the face. This hairstyle works well for those with straight or wavy hair.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can soften the face and draw attention away from the cheeks. The bangs should be long enough to cover the forehead and swept to the side. This hairstyle works well for those with medium-length hair.</p><h3>3. Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut can create a bold and edgy look while flattering a round and fat face. The short layers can add volume to the crown, while the tapered sides and back can elongate the face. This hairstyle works well for those with thick and coarse hair.</p><h2>Step by step</h2><p>To achieve the perfect hairstyle for your round and fat face, follow these steps:</p><h3>1. Consult with your hairstylist</h3><p>Discuss your options with your hairstylist and ask for their opinion. They can recommend a hairstyle that suits your face shape and flatters your features.</p><h3>2. Determine your hair type</h3><p>Consider your hair type when choosing a hairstyle. Different hairstyles work better for different hair types, such as straight, wavy, curly, or thick hair.</p><h3>3. Choose the right length</h3><p>Choose a length that flatters your face shape. Long layers and side-swept bangs can elongate the face, while a pixie cut can create a bold and edgy look.</p><h3>4. Add volume</h3><p>Add volume to the crown to create the illusion of a longer face shape. This can be achieved by using a volumizing mousse or blow-drying the hair upside down.</p><h3>5. Use the right products</h3><p>Use products that are suitable for your hair type and style. For example, use a smoothing serum for frizzy hair, or a texturizing spray for fine hair.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when choosing a hairstyle for your round and fat face:</p><h3>1. Avoid blunt cuts</h3><p>Avoid blunt cuts that end at the chin, as they can create a horizontal line that accentuates the roundness of the face.</p><h3>2. Embrace layers</h3><p>Embrace layers to add volume and movement to the hair. Layers that start at the cheekbones and flow downwards can elongate the jawline and slim down the face.</p><h3>3. Experiment with color</h3><p>Experiment with color to add depth and dimension to the hair. Highlights or lowlights can create the illusion of depth and make the face appear slimmer.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I wear a bob if I have a round and fat face?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can wear a bob if you have a round and fat face. However, make sure the length is not too short and the cut is not too blunt. A layered bob that ends at the shoulders can create the illusion of a longer face shape.</p><h3>Q: Should I avoid wearing my hair up?</h3><p>A: No, you can wear your hair up if you have a round and fat face. However, avoid tight and sleek updos, as they can accentuate the roundness of the face. Instead, opt for loose and messy updos that add volume and texture.</p><h3>Q: Can I wear bangs if I have a round and fat face?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can wear bangs if you have a round and fat face. However, choose side-swept bangs that are long enough to cover the forehead and swept to the side. Avoid blunt and straight bangs that end at the eyebrows, as they can create a horizontal line that accentuates the roundness of the face.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To maintain your hairstyle, follow these hair care tips:</p><h3>1. Use the right shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Use a shampoo and conditioner that are suitable for your hair type and style. For example, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner for dry hair, or a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for fine hair.</p><h3>2. Avoid heat styling</h3><p>Avoid heat styling as much as possible, as it can damage the hair and make it prone to breakage. If you must use heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray and set the temperature to a low or medium setting.</p><h3>3. Trim regularly</h3><p>Trim your hair regularly to maintain the shape and prevent split ends. Visit your hairstylist every 6 to 8 weeks for a trim.</p><p>In conclusion, finding the perfect hairstyle for a round and fat face is all about creating the illusion of a longer and more angular face shape. Choose a hairstyle that flatters your face shape, adds volume to the crown, and draws attention away from the cheeks and chin. With the right knowledge and techniques, you can achieve a hairstyle that accentuates your features and boosts your confidence.</p></article>
