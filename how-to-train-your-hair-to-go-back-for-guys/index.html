However, it can be a bit challenging to get your hair to stay in place, especially if you have thick or curly hair. In this article, we'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to train your hair to go back for guys, as well as some helpful tips and FAQs. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li><a href="#step1">Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step2">Step 2: Apply Product</a></li><li><a href="#step3">Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step4">Step 4: Comb Your Hair Back</a></li><li><a href="#step5">Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Training Your Hair to Go Back</a></li><li><a href="#faqs">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care Tips</a></li></ul><h2 id="step1"> Step 1: Start with Clean Hair </h2><p> Before you start training your hair to go back, it's important to start with clean hair. This will make it easier for you to apply product and style your hair. Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to clean and moisturize your hair. </p><h2 id="step2"> Step 2: Apply Product </h2><p> Once your hair is clean and dry, it's time to apply product. Choose a product that works well for your hair type and texture. For thick or curly hair, a strong-hold gel or pomade is recommended. For fine or thin hair, a lighter product like a mousse or cream may work better. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, starting at the roots and working your way to the ends. </p><h2 id="step3"> Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair </h2><p> After applying product, use a blow dryer to dry your hair. Use a medium heat setting and a round brush to create volume and texture. This will help to train your hair to go back and stay in place. </p><h2 id="step4"> Step 4: Comb Your Hair Back </h2><p> Once your hair is dry, use a comb to comb your hair back. Start at the front of your hairline and work your way back. Use a comb with fine teeth to create a sleek and smooth look. </p><h2 id="step5"> Step 5: Finish with Hairspray </h2><p> To ensure that your hair stays in place all day, finish with a strong-hold hairspray. Spray the hairspray evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the areas where your hair tends to fall out of place. </p><h2 id="tips"> Tips for Training Your Hair to Go Back </h2><p> Here are a few additional tips to help you train your hair to go back: </p><ul><li> Be patient – it may take a few weeks for your hair to get used to being styled back </li><li> Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and moisturized </li><li> Experiment with different products to find what works best for your hair type </li><li> Use a comb with fine teeth to create a sleek and smooth look </li><li> Don't be afraid to ask your barber or hairstylist for advice on how to style your hair </li></ul><h2 id="faqs"> FAQs </h2><p> Here are a few frequently asked questions about training your hair to go back: </p><h3> How long will it take to train my hair to go back? </h3><p> It may take a few weeks to a few months for your hair to get used to being styled back. Be patient and consistent with your styling routine. </p><h3> What kind of product should I use to train my hair to go back? </h3><p> The product you use will depend on your hair type and texture. For thick or curly hair, a strong-hold gel or pomade is recommended. For fine or thin hair, a lighter product like a mousse or cream may work better. </p><h3> How often should I wash my hair when training it to go back? </h3><p> It's important to wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy. However, washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils and make it harder to style. Aim to wash your hair every 2-3 days, or as needed. </p><h2 id="haircare"> Hair Care Tips </h2><p> To keep your hair healthy and looking its best, it's important to take good care of it.
