They're versatile, classic, and can work for almost any occasion. However, if you have thick hair, achieving the perfect slicked back look can be a bit challenging. But fear not – with the right products and techniques, you can master the art of slicking back thick hair in no time. In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know to achieve a sleek and stylish look. </p><h2> How to Slick Back Men's Hair Thick </h2><p> Before we dive into the step-by-step instructions, let's take a look at the products you'll need to achieve a slicked back look on thick hair. Here's what you'll need: </p><ul><li> Pomade </li><li> Comb or brush </li><li> Hair dryer (optional) </li><li> Hair tie or elastic band (optional) </li></ul><h3> Step 1: Start with clean, damp hair </h3><p> Begin by washing your hair with a high-quality shampoo and conditioner. This will help remove any dirt or product buildup from your hair and make it easier to style. Once you've washed your hair, towel dry it until it's damp, but not dripping wet. </p><h3> Step 2: Apply pomade </h3><p> Take a small amount of pomade and rub it between your palms to warm it up. Then, apply it evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the roots and the sides. Make sure to distribute the product evenly to avoid clumping or greasy spots. </p><h3> Step 3: Comb your hair back </h3><p> Using a wide-tooth comb or brush, comb your hair back from the front of your head to the back. Make sure to comb your hair in the direction you want it to stay. If you have a cowlick or a stubborn part, you may need to use a hair dryer to help train your hair to stay in place. </p><h3> Step 4: Style your hair </h3><p> Once your hair is slicked back, you can style it in a variety of ways. You can leave it loose and natural, or you can use a hair tie or elastic band to create a ponytail or bun. You can also add a part or a fade to create a more structured look. Experiment with different styles to find the one that works best for you. </p><h2> Tips for Slicking Back Men's Thick Hair </h2><p> Here are a few tips to keep in mind when slicking back thick hair: </p><ul><li> Use a high-quality pomade that's designed for thick hair </li><li> Start with a small amount of product and add more as needed </li><li> Comb your hair in the direction you want it to stay </li><li> Use a hair dryer on a low setting to help train your hair to stay in place </li><li> Experiment with different styles to find the one that works best for you </li></ul><h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2><h3> How much pomade should I use? </h3><p> Start with a small amount of pomade, about the size of a dime. You can always add more if you need it, but using too much can make your hair look greasy and weighed down. </p><h3> Can I slick back my hair without pomade? </h3><p> While pomade is the most popular product for slicking back hair, you can also use gel, wax, or hairspray to achieve a similar look. Just make sure to choose a product that's designed for your hair type and texture. </p><h3> Can I slick back my hair if it's not thick? </h3><p> Absolutely! Slicked back hairstyles can work for almost any hair type and texture. However, if you have fine or thin hair, you may need to use a lighter product or add volume with a hair dryer to achieve the desired look. </p><h2> Hair Care for Slicked Back Hair </h2><p> To keep your slicked back hair looking its best, it's important to take good care of your hair. Here are a few tips to keep in mind: </p><ul><li> Wash your hair regularly with a high-quality shampoo and conditioner </li><li> Use a hair mask or deep conditioner once a week to keep your hair moisturized </li><li> Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can cause damage and breakage </li><li> Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends and breakage </li></ul><p> With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to slick back your thick hair like a pro. Whether you're getting ready for a night out or just want to switch up your everyday style, a slicked back hairstyle is a classic and versatile choice. </p></article>
