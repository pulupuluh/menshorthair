Avoid using hot tools such as flat irons or blow dryers too often, as they can cause breakage and split ends.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Beautiful Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve beautiful, healthy curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to dry your hair, as regular towels can cause frizz.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause breakage and frizz.
