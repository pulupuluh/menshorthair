This is because hormones affect the shape of your hair follicles, which in turn affects the texture of your hair. The most common hormonal changes that can cause your hair to become curly are puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. During these times, your body produces more hormones that affect your hair.</p><h2 id="heat-damage">Heat Damage</h2><p>If you frequently use heat tools such as flat irons or curling irons, your hair may be damaged, and the damage can cause your hair to become curly. Heat damage can cause your hair to lose its natural shape, resulting in curls or waves. To prevent heat damage, try to limit your use of heat tools, and use a heat protectant spray when you do use them.</p><h2 id="product-buildup">Product Buildup</h2><p>Product buildup can also cause your hair to become curly. If you use too much product on your hair or don't wash your hair frequently enough, product buildup can occur. This buildup can weigh your hair down, causing it to lose its natural shape and become curly or wavy. To prevent product buildup, use less product on your hair and make sure to wash your hair regularly.</p><h2 id="weather-changes">Weather Changes</h2><p>Weather changes can also affect the texture of your hair. Humidity, in particular, can cause your hair to become curly or frizzy. Humidity can cause your hair to absorb moisture from the air, which can cause it to lose its natural shape. To prevent this, use products that are designed to control frizz, and avoid going outside on humid days.</p><h2 id="genetics">Genetics</h2><p>Your hair texture is largely determined by your genetics. If you have a family history of curly hair, it's possible that you inherited the gene that causes curly hair. In this case, there's not much you can do to change the texture of your hair. However, you can learn to embrace your curls and work with them to create a style that you love.</p><h2 id="how-to-deal-with-curly-hair">How to Deal with Curly Hair</h2><p>If you're not used to having curly hair, it can be difficult to know how to deal with it.
