Don't worry, you're not alone. Receding hairline is a common problem among men, and it can be caused by genetics, age, stress, or hormonal changes.

Instead, you should opt for a haircut that makes your face appear longer, like a buzz cut or a crew cut. If you have a square face, you can go for a longer haircut with textured layers to soften your features.</p><p>When it comes to hair types, men with thinning hair should avoid long hairstyles that can make their hair look even thinner. A shorter haircut with a textured top can help create an illusion of thickness. Men with curly hair can opt for a short haircut with a fade on the sides and back to create contrast and definition.</p><p>The severity of your receding hairline also plays a role in choosing the best haircut. If you have a mild receding hairline, you can go for a classic side-parted hairstyle or a short buzz cut. If your hairline is more severe, you can try a textured crop or a shaved head.</p><p>Lastly, your lifestyle and personal style should also be taken into consideration.
