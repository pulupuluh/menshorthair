Do you want to save money by cutting your hair at home? Well, you're in luck because cutting hair with clippers only is easier than you think! In this post, we'll show you how to cut hair with clippers only and give you some tips and tricks to make it a success.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Cut Hair with Clippers Only</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Cutting Hair with Clippers Only</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care After Cutting Hair with Clippers Only</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut Hair with Clippers Only</h2><p>Before we get started, let's talk about the tools you'll need. You'll need hair clippers, scissors, a comb, and a mirror. You can buy a set of hair clippers at your local beauty supply store or online. Make sure to choose a set that comes with different guard sizes for different lengths of hair.</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Guard Size</h3><p>Start by choosing the right guard size. The guard size will determine the length of the hair you're cutting. For example, if you want a shorter haircut, use a smaller guard size. If you want a longer haircut, use a larger guard size. If you're not sure which guard size to use, start with a longer guard size and work your way down.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before you start cutting. This will make it easier to cut and will also help you see the natural shape of your hair. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start cutting.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Use a comb to section your hair. Start by separating the top section of your hair from the bottom section. Use hair clips to hold the top section in place.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Cutting</h3><p>Start cutting your hair with the clippers. Begin at the back of your head and work your way up. Use the comb to lift the hair and run the clippers over it. Make sure to keep the clippers at a 90-degree angle to your head to get an even cut.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Hair</h3><p>After you've cut the back of your head, move on to the sides. Use the same technique to cut the sides. Make sure to blend the hair between the back and sides to avoid any harsh lines.</p><h3>Step 6: Cut the Top Section</h3><p>Now it's time to cut the top section of your hair. Use the scissors to cut the hair to the desired length. Make sure to cut the hair evenly and at the same length.</p><h3>Step 7: Style Your Hair</h3><p>After you've cut your hair, style it to your liking. You can use a hair dryer, styling products, or even a flat iron to achieve your desired look.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Hair with Clippers Only</h2><p>Here are some tips to make cutting hair with clippers only a success:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard size and work your way down if you're not sure which guard size to use.</li><li>Use the comb to lift the hair and run the clippers over it to get an even cut.</li><li>Blend the hair between the back and sides to avoid any harsh lines.</li><li>Use the scissors to cut the top section of your hair to the desired length.</li><li>Style your hair to your liking after you've cut it.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting hair with clippers only:</p><h3>Can I cut my hair with clippers without a guard?</h3><p>We don't recommend cutting your hair with clippers without a guard.
