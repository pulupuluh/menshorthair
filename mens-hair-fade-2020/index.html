In this article, we'll show you how to get the perfect fade, step by step. We'll also give you some tips on how to maintain your new look and answer some frequently asked questions about the mens hair fade.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The mens hair fade is a haircut that features a gradual transition from short to long hair. The hair is cut short at the bottom and gradually gets longer as it goes up the sides and back of the head. The top of the hair can be left long or cut to a shorter length. The result is a clean and modern look that is easy to maintain.</p><h2>How to Get the Perfect Mens Hair Fade 2020</h2><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Fade Style</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, you need to decide on the type of fade you want. There are different types of fades, including low fade, high fade, mid fade, and skin fade. Each type of fade has a different level of hair length difference between the top and bottom of the head. The low fade has a small difference, while the skin fade has no hair at the bottom.</p><h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before you start cutting. This will make it easier to cut and style. Comb your hair to remove any tangles or knots. Use a clipper to trim the hair at the bottom of your head to the desired length. Make sure the clipper guard is set to the right length.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Begin cutting the hair at the sides and back of your head. Use a clipper to create a gradual transition from short to long hair. Move the clipper up the head, using different guard sizes to create the fade. Blend the hair between the different lengths to create a smooth transition.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top</h3><p>Cut the hair on the top of your head to the desired length. You can leave it long or cut it short. Use scissors or a clipper to trim the hair. Blend the top with the sides and back to create a seamless look.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Use a styling product, such as pomade or wax, to style your hair. Apply the product to your hands and run them through your hair. Style your hair to your desired look.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Mens Hair Fade 2020</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining your mens hair fade:</p><ul><li>Visit your barber regularly to keep your hair looking fresh.</li><li>Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy.</li><li>Use a conditioner to keep your hair soft and manageable.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your hair.</li></ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What is a mens hair fade?</h3><p>A mens hair fade is a haircut that features a gradual transition from short to long hair.
