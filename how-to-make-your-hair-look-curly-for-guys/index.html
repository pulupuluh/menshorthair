Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner to cleanse and condition your hair. Avoid products with sulfates or harsh chemicals, as these can strip your hair of its natural oils.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Curl-Enhancing Cream or Mousse</h3><p>Next, apply a curl-enhancing cream or mousse to your damp hair. Work the product through your hair, ensuring that it's evenly distributed. Be sure to avoid applying too much product, as this can weigh your hair down and make it look greasy.</p><h3>Step 3: Diffuse Your Hair</h3><p>Once your product is applied, it's time to diffuse your hair. Attach a diffuser to your hair dryer, and turn it on low heat. Use the diffuser to gently scrunch your hair as you dry it. This will help to create and define your curls.</p><h3>Step 4: Apply Hair Spray</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, apply a light hold hair spray to set your curls in place. Be sure to hold the hair spray at least six inches from your head to avoid weighing your hair down.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Curly Hair</h2><p>Now that you've achieved curly hair for guys, it's important to maintain it.
