Avoid using hot water, as this can also cause damage and frizz. Instead, use warm water and take your time when washing your hair.</p><h2>Tips for Caring for Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for keeping your curly hair looking its best:</p><ul><li>Avoid using hot styling tools, as these can cause damage and frizz.</li><li>Use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when wet.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause frizz.</li><li>Avoid using harsh chemicals, such as hair dyes and relaxers.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and wind by wearing a hat or scarf.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What are some good shampoos for curly hair at Target?</h3><p>Some of the best shampoos for curly hair at Target include Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Shampoo, DevaCurl No-Poo Original Zero Lather Conditioning Cleanser, and Cantu Shea Butter for Natural Hair Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo.</p><h3>Do I need to use a conditioner with my curly hair shampoo?</h3><p>Yes, it's important to use a conditioner designed for curly hair after shampooing.
