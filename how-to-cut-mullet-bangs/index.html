Use your scissors to cut straight across, making sure that the length is even.

Use your scissors to cut the hair at an angle, starting from the top of your head and moving toward the front. The length of the hair should gradually get shorter as you move toward the front, blending seamlessly with the bangs. Repeat on the other side.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Back</h3><p>Finally, release the back section of your hair and comb it forward. Cut the hair at an angle, starting from the top of your head and moving toward the nape of your neck. The length of the hair should gradually get longer as you move toward the back, blending seamlessly with the longer layers.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a more detailed breakdown of the steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Make sure you have all the necessary tools before you start.
