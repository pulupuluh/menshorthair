However, not all bangs are created equal, and some types may not be suitable for those with relaxed hair. The best bangs for over 60 with relaxed hair are those that are easy to maintain, complement your face shape, and work well with your hair texture. In this guide, we'll help you choose the best bangs for your hair type and face shape.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Best Bangs for Over 60</h2><p>Choosing the best bangs for over 60 with relaxed hair requires some consideration. Here are some factors to consider when choosing your bangs:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>The shape of your face can determine which type of bangs will suit you best. For example, if you have a round face, you might want to choose side-swept bangs to add length to your face. If you have a heart-shaped face, you might want to try blunt, straight-across bangs to balance out your features.</p><h3>Hair Texture</h3><p>Your hair texture can also affect which type of bangs will work well for you. If you have fine hair, you might want to avoid thick, heavy bangs that can weigh down your hair. Instead, try wispy, textured bangs. If you have thick hair, you might want to try blunt, straight-across bangs that will create a clean, polished look.</p><h3>Personal Style</h3><p>Your personal style is also an important factor to consider when choosing your bangs. If you prefer a classic, timeless look, you might want to try blunt, straight-across bangs. If you're more adventurous and like to experiment with your hair, you might want to try choppy, textured bangs.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide on Styling Your Bangs</h2><p>Styling your bangs can be easy with the right techniques. Here's a step by step guide on how to style your bangs:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Before styling your bangs, make sure your hair is clean and dry. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Off Your Bangs</h3><p>Section off your bangs from the rest of your hair by using a comb or your fingers. Make sure your bangs are damp before styling them.</p><h3>Step 3: Style Your Bangs</h3><p>Depending on the type of bangs you have, you can style them in different ways. For example, if you have side-swept bangs, you can use a round brush and a hair dryer to create volume and curl. If you have blunt, straight-across bangs, you can use a flat iron to create a sleek and polished look.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Once you've styled your bangs, finish with a light mist of hairspray to keep them in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips on Maintaining Your Bangs</h2><p>Maintaining your bangs can be easy with these tips:</p><h3>Trim Your Bangs Regularly</h3><p>To keep your bangs looking their best, trim them every 4-6 weeks. This will prevent them from getting too long and falling in your eyes.</p><h3>Wash Your Bangs Separately</h3><p>If you have oily skin, you might want to wash your bangs separately from the rest of your hair. This will prevent them from getting greasy and flat.</p><h3>Blow Dry Your Bangs Every Day</h3><p>Blow drying your bangs every day will help them stay in place and maintain their shape.</p><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What are the best bangs for over 60 with relaxed hair?</h3><p>The best bangs for over 60 with relaxed hair are those that are easy to maintain, complement your face shape, and work well with your hair texture.
