Allergies</h3><p>Cats can develop allergies to a variety of things, including food, flea bites, and environmental factors like dust or pollen. These allergies can cause skin irritation, which can lead to hair loss.</p><h3>2. Fungal Infections</h3><p>Fungal infections like ringworm can cause hair loss in cats. Ringworm is a contagious infection that can spread to humans, so it’s important to get your cat treated if you suspect they have it.</p><h3>3. Parasites</h3><p>Parasites like fleas, mites, and lice can cause your cat to scratch and chew at their skin, leading to hair loss. Regular flea prevention and treatment can help prevent this issue.</p><h3>4. Stress</h3><p>Cats can experience stress for a variety of reasons, including changes in their environment, the addition of a new pet, or a change in routine. Stress can cause cats to over-groom, leading to hair loss in certain areas.</p><h2 id="identification">Identifying Hair Loss in Cats</h2><p>If you notice patches of hair missing from your cat, it’s important to identify the cause so you can provide the appropriate treatment. Some signs to look for include:</p><ul><li>Bald patches on the skin</li><li>Red, inflamed skin</li><li>Bumps or scabs on the skin</li><li>Excessive scratching or licking</li><li>Changes in behavior, such as increased aggression or lethargy</li></ul><h2 id="treatment">Treatment for Hair Loss in Cats</h2><p>The treatment for hair loss in cats will depend on the underlying cause.
