Wet hair is easier to cut, so spray some water if necessary.</li><li>Divide the hair into sections using clips or elastics. Start by parting the hair down the middle and then dividing it into four sections: two at the front and two at the back.</li><li>Start cutting the hair from the back. Hold a small section of hair between your fingers and cut it straight across. Make sure to keep the scissors parallel to the hair to avoid uneven cuts.</li><li>Use the first section as a guide for the rest of the hair. Keep cutting small sections of hair, using the first section as a guide for length and shape.</li><li>Move to the sides and front of the head. Use the same technique to cut the hair on the sides and front, making sure to blend the hair from the back.</li><li>Cut around the ears. Use the comb to lift the hair above the ear and cut it straight across. Repeat on the other side.</li><li>Trim the bangs. Use the comb to separate the bangs from the rest of the hair and cut them to the desired length. You can cut them straight across or at an angle for a more modern look.</li><li>Check for any uneven spots. Run your fingers through your child's hair to check for any uneven spots. Use the scissors to trim any areas that need it.</li><li>Remove the clips or elastics and style the hair. Use the comb to style your child's hair as desired.</li><li>Clean up.

When cutting the sides and front, make sure to blend the hair from the back to avoid any harsh lines.</li><li>Ask for help. If you're having trouble cutting your child's hair, don't be afraid to ask for help from a friend or family member.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting a child's hair with scissors:</p><p><strong>How often should I cut my child's hair?</strong></p><p>It depends on how fast your child's hair grows.
