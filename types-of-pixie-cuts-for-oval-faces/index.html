If you're considering a pixie cut, it's important to choose a style that flatters your face shape. Oval faces are lucky in that they can pull off a variety of pixie cuts. In this article, we'll cover how to choose the right pixie cut for your oval face, step-by-step instructions on how to style it, tips for maintaining your cut, and more!</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to-choose">How to Choose the Right Pixie Cut for Your Oval Face</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions for Styling Your Pixie Cut</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Pixie Cut</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Pixie Cuts</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-choose">How to Choose the Right Pixie Cut for Your Oval Face</h2><p>If you have an oval face, you have a lot of options when it comes to pixie cuts. The key is to choose a cut that balances out your face shape. Here are some of the best types of pixie cuts for oval faces:</p><h3>1. Long Pixie Cut</h3><p>The long pixie cut is a great option for oval faces because it adds volume to the top of your head, which balances out your face shape. To achieve this look, keep the sides and back of your hair short, while leaving the top longer. You can style your hair with a deep side part or by sweeping it to the side.</p><h3>2. Textured Pixie Cut</h3><p>A textured pixie cut is another great option for oval faces. This cut adds texture and movement to your hair, which softens your face shape. To achieve this look, ask your stylist to add layers and texture to your hair. You can style your hair with a messy, tousled look or with defined curls.</p><h3>3. Side-Swept Pixie Cut</h3><p>A side-swept pixie cut is a classic look that flatters oval faces. This cut features long bangs that are swept to the side, which helps to balance out your face shape. To achieve this look, keep the sides and back of your hair short, while leaving the top longer. Style your hair with a deep side part and sweep your bangs to the side.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions for Styling Your Pixie Cut</h2><p>Now that you've chosen the right pixie cut for your oval face, it's time to learn how to style it. Here are step-by-step instructions:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Use a clarifying shampoo if you have a lot of product buildup.</p><h3>2. Towel-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Gently towel-dry your hair until it's damp. Don't rub your hair with the towel, as this can cause damage and frizz.</p><h3>3. Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Apply styling product to your hair, such as mousse or gel. This will help to add volume and hold to your hair.</p><h3>4. Blow-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a blow dryer, dry your hair while using your fingers to shape your hair. You can use a round brush to add volume to your hair.</p><h3>5. Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a flat iron or curling iron to style your hair. You can create loose curls or waves, or go for a sleek and straight look. Finish with hairspray to hold your style in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Pixie Cut</h2><p>Now that you've styled your pixie cut, it's important to maintain it. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>To keep your pixie cut looking fresh, it's important to trim your hair every 4-6 weeks. This will help to prevent split ends and keep your hair healthy.</p><h3>2. Use Dry Shampoo</h3><p>Dry shampoo is a great way to refresh your hair in between washes. Simply spray it on your roots and brush it through your hair to absorb oil and add volume.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair</h3><p>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before using hot tools. You should also avoid using hot tools every day, as this can cause damage and breakage.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>1. Will a pixie cut make my face look too round?</h3><p>No, a pixie cut can actually help to balance out a round face by adding height and volume to the top of your head.</p><h3>2. Can I still style my pixie cut if I have thin hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can still style a pixie cut if you have thin hair. Just be sure to use volumizing products and add layers to your hair to create texture and movement.</p><h3>3. Is it okay to color my hair if I have a pixie cut?</h3><p>Yes, you can color your hair if you have a pixie cut. Just be sure to use a color-safe shampoo and conditioner, and avoid over-processing your hair.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Pixie Cuts</h2><p>Finally, here are some hair care tips for pixie cuts:</p><h3>1. Use a Gentle Shampoo</h3><p>Choose a gentle shampoo that won't strip your hair of its natural oils. Look for shampoos that are sulfate-free and contain natural ingredients.</p><h3>2. Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Condition your hair regularly to keep it hydrated and healthy. Use a leave-in conditioner to add extra moisture to your hair.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>The sun can damage your hair, so be sure to protect it with a hat or scarf when you're outside. You can also use a hair sunscreen to protect your hair from UV rays.</p><p>We hope you found this guide to the best types of pixie cuts for oval faces helpful.
