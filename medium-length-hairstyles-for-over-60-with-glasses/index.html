Look no further than medium length hairstyles! Not too short and not too long, medium length hairstyles are a great option for women over 60 who want to look stylish and feel confident. Read on for our tips on how to choose and style the perfect medium length hairstyle for your glasses.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Medium length hairstyles are typically considered to be shoulder-length, falling between chin and collarbone. This length is versatile and allows for a variety of styling options, making it a great choice for women over 60 who want to switch up their look. If you wear glasses, it’s important to choose a hairstyle that complements your frames and doesn’t detract from them.</p><h2>How to Choose a Medium Length Hairstyle for Your Glasses</h2><p>When choosing a medium length hairstyle, there are a few things to keep in mind if you wear glasses:</p><ul><li>Consider the shape of your frames. Round frames pair well with more angular hairstyles, while angular frames look best with softer, wavy hairstyles.</li><li>Think about your face shape. If you have a round face, a layered hairstyle can help elongate your features. If you have a more angular face, a side-swept bang can soften your look.</li><li>Take your hair texture into account. If you have fine hair, a blunt bob can add volume and thickness. If you have thick hair, layers can help lighten the weight of your hair.</li></ul><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Styling a Medium Length Hairstyle with Glasses</h2><p>Here’s how to style your medium length hairstyle with glasses:</p><ol><li>Shampoo and condition your hair as usual.</li><li>Towel dry your hair and apply a heat protectant.</li><li>Blow dry your hair using a round brush to add volume and curl under the ends.</li><li>If desired, use a curling iron to add more defined curls or waves.</li><li>Finish with a light hold hairspray to keep your style in place.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Medium Length Hairstyle with Glasses</h2><p>To keep your medium length hairstyle looking its best, follow these tips:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape and health of your hair.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair moisturized.</li><li>Invest in a good quality heat protectant to prevent damage from styling tools.</li><li>Switch up your part to avoid a flat, lifeless look.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What are some popular medium length hairstyles for women over 60 with glasses?</h3><p>Some popular medium length hairstyles for women over 60 with glasses include a layered bob, a shaggy lob, and a long bob with side-swept bangs.</p><h3>Can I still wear bangs if I wear glasses?</h3><p>Absolutely! Bangs can be a great way to change up your look and complement your glasses. Consider a side-swept bang or a wispy fringe for a softer, more feminine look.</p><h2>Hair Care for Medium Length Hairstyles with Glasses</h2><p>While medium length hairstyles are versatile and easy to style, it’s important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best.
