However, finding the perfect short style for your face shape can be a bit tricky. If you have a full face shape and want to go for a short style, you might be wondering what will look best on you. In this article, we'll discuss the different face shapes and which ones are best for short full styles.</p><h2>What are the Different Face Shapes?</h2><p>Before we dive into which face shapes are best for short full styles, let's first go over the different face shapes. The most common face shapes are:</p><ul><li>Round</li><li>Oval</li><li>Square</li><li>Heart</li><li>Diamond</li></ul><h2>Which Face Shapes are Best for Short Full Styles?</h2><p>If you have a round or oval face shape, short full styles can work great for you. The key is to create volume on top to balance out your face shape. This can be achieved with layers, curls, or a messy pixie cut. Square face shapes can also pull off short full styles, but it's important to keep the volume on the top and not at the sides.</p><p>Heart-shaped faces can also wear short full styles, but it's important to add volume to the sides to balance out your face shape. A layered bob or a side-swept pixie cut can work well for this face shape. Diamond face shapes can also wear short full styles, but it's important to keep the volume at the top and not at the sides.</p><h2>How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>If you're not sure what your face shape is, there are a few ways to determine it. One way is to stand in front of a mirror and trace the outline of your face onto the mirror with lipstick or eyeliner. Once you've done this, step back and take a look at the shape you've created. Another way is to measure your face with a measuring tape. Measure the distance between your hairline and jawline, and then measure the distance between your cheekbones. If your cheekbones are wider than your jawline, you have a diamond or heart-shaped face. If they're the same width, you have a square face. If your jawline is rounded, you have a round face. And if your face is longer than it is wide, you have an oval face shape.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving a Short Full Style</h2><p>Now that you know which face shapes are best for short full styles, here's a step-by-step guide to achieving this look:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair.</li><li>Apply a volumizing mousse or spray to your roots and work it through with your fingers.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair upside down to create volume at the roots.</li><li>Use a round brush to create volume and shape your hair.</li><li>Finish with a texturizing spray or pomade to add texture and hold.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Short Full Style</h2><p>Short full styles require regular maintenance to keep them looking their best. Here are some tips for maintaining your short full style:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair looking neat and tidy.</li><li>Use a dry shampoo to extend the life of your style between washes.</li><li>Avoid using heavy styling products that can weigh your hair down.</li><li>Consider getting regular color touch-ups to keep your hair looking vibrant and healthy.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Can I wear a short full style if I have a long face?</h3><p>Short full styles can be tricky for long face shapes. The key is to create volume at the sides to balance out your face shape. A layered bob or a side-swept pixie cut can work well for this face shape.</p><h3>Will a short full style make my face look wider?</h3><p>Short full styles can actually make your face look slimmer if done correctly. The key is to create volume at the top to balance out your face shape.</p><h2>Hair Care for Short Full Styles</h2><p>Short full styles require regular care to keep them looking their best. Here are some hair care tips for short full styles:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools on a daily basis to prevent damage to your hair.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair soft and shiny.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh your hair down and make it look greasy.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you have a full face shape and want to go for a short full style, there are plenty of options available to you. The key is to create volume at the top to balance out your face shape. Whether you have a round, oval, square, heart, or diamond face shape, there's a short full style out there that will work for you. Just remember to take good care of your hair to keep it looking its best.</p></article>
