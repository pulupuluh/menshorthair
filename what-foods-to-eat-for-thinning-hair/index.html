Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include:</p><ul><li>Fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel</li><li>Walnuts</li><li>Flaxseeds</li></ul><h3 id="section7">Vitamin C-rich Foods</h3><p>Vitamin C is important for healthy hair growth, as it helps your body produce collagen. Collagen is a protein that helps strengthen your hair. Good sources of vitamin C include:</p><ul><li>Citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruits</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Guava</li></ul><h3 id="section8">Biotin-rich Foods</h3><p>Biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for healthy hair growth.

Eating a healthy diet, reducing stress, and using hair growth products can help promote healthy hair growth.</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my hair?</h3><p>A: Itâs best to wash your hair every 2-3 days, as washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils.</p><p>In conclusion, eating a healthy diet is essential for promoting healthy hair growth and preventing hair loss.
