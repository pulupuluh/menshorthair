Cut another small piece of ribbon (about 6 inches long) that will be used to wrap around the center of the bow.</p><h3>Step 2: Fold the Ribbon</h3><p>Fold the ribbon back and forth like an accordion, making sure that each fold is the same size. Use your fingers to hold the folds in place.</p><h3>Step 3: Tie the Ribbon</h3><p>Take the small piece of ribbon you cut earlier and wrap it around the center of the folded ribbon. Tie a knot to secure it in place.</p><h3>Step 4: Fluff the Bow</h3><p>Gently pull each fold of the ribbon to the center of the bow, fluffing it up as you go. Make sure that the bow is symmetrical and adjust the folds as needed.</p><h3>Step 5: Attach the Barrette or Hair Elastic</h3><p>Turn the bow over and sew or glue a barrette or hair elastic to the back. Make sure that it is securely attached so that it doesn't fall out of your hair.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Making Big Hair Bows</h2><ul><li>Use a high-quality ribbon that will hold its shape.</li><li>Experiment with different widths and textures of ribbon to create unique bows.</li><li>Try adding embellishments like beads or rhinestones to the center of the bow.</li><li>Practice makes perfect!
