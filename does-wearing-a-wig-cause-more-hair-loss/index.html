A wig that is too tight can cause traction alopecia, while a wig that is too loose can slip and cause further hair loss.</p><p>You should also opt for wigs made from high-quality materials, such as human hair or synthetic fibers that mimic the look and feel of natural hair.

A wig cap made from breathable materials, such as cotton or nylon, can help reduce scalp irritation and prevent infection. Additionally, a wig cap can help keep your natural hair in place and prevent further hair loss.</p><h3>Take Breaks</h3><p>If you wear a wig for an extended period of time, it is essential to take breaks.
