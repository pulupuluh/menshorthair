Look for treatments that contain ingredients like tea tree oil, which can help reduce inflammation and improve circulation. </p><h3>3.

Look for oils like argan, coconut, or jojoba oil, which can penetrate the hair shaft and provide deep hydration. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for using a hair treatment:</p><h3>1.
