All you need is a pair of sharp scissors and a comb. Here’s how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure your hair is clean and dry. This will make it easier to see the length and shape of your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide on the Length</h3><p>Decide on the length you want to cut your hair. It’s a good idea to start with a little bit and work your way up, rather than cutting too much off at once.</p><h3>Step 3: Part Your Hair</h3><p>Part your hair where you want to cut it. This could be in the middle or on the side, depending on your preference.</p><h3>Step 4: Comb Your Hair Forward</h3><p>Comb your hair forward so that it’s flat against your forehead. This will make it easier to see the length you want to cut.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut Your Hair</h3><p>Using your scissors, cut your hair at the length you’ve decided on. Start with small snips, and work your way up to the desired length.</p><h3>Step 6: Check Your Progress</h3><p>Check your progress in the mirror to make sure you’re happy with the length and shape of your hair. If you need to make any adjustments, do so carefully and slowly.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you’re still feeling a little unsure about how to cut your hair at the front, here’s a more detailed step-by-step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Supplies</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have everything you need.
