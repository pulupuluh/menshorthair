This style features short hair on the sides and back, and longer hair on top, with a messy and textured finish. The textured crop haircut is perfect for men with thick wavy hair because it allows for natural movement and emphasizes the hair's natural texture. This style is low maintenance, easy to style, and looks great on all face shapes.</p><h2>How to: Get the Textured Crop Haircut</h2><p>Getting the textured crop haircut is easy, and you can do it at home, or you can visit a hairstylist. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, you will need a few tools. You will need a good quality pair of scissors, a comb, and a clipper with guard sizes 1 to 3.</p><h3>Step 2: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair and towel dry it. Comb your hair in the direction you want it to fall.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use the clipper with guard size 1 to cut the sides and back of your hair. Start from the bottom and work your way up, using the comb to guide you. Repeat this step with guard size 2 and then 3, blending the hair as you go.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top</h3><p>Using the scissors, cut the hair on top to the desired length. Cut the hair in small sections, starting from the front and working your way back. Use the comb to lift the hair and cut it at an angle to create texture and movement.</p><h3>Step 5: Texturize</h3><p>Use the scissors to texturize the hair on top. Cut into the ends of the hair to create a messy and textured finish.</p><h3>Step 6: Style</h3><p>Apply a small amount of hair product to the hair and style it as desired. For a messy and textured finish, use your fingers to tousle the hair.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Textured Crop Haircut</h2><p>Now that you have the textured crop haircut, it is essential to maintain it. Here are some tips to keep your haircut looking fresh:</p><ul><li>Visit your hairstylist every six weeks to trim the hair on the sides and back.</li><li>Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, like blow dryers and flat irons, too often, as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Apply a hair mask once a week to nourish your hair and keep it hydrated.</li></ul><h2>FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: How long does the textured crop haircut last?</h3><p>A: The textured crop haircut can last up to six weeks before it needs to be trimmed again.</p><h3>Q: Can I style the textured crop haircut differently?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can. The textured crop haircut is versatile and can be styled in different ways, depending on your preference.</p><h3>Q: Can I get the textured crop haircut if I have straight hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can. However, the textured crop haircut looks best on men with thick wavy hair.</p><h3>Q: Do I need to use hair product to style the textured crop haircut?</h3><p>A: Yes, you do. Hair product helps to hold the hair in place and create the messy and textured finish.</p><h2>Hair Care: Final Thoughts</h2><p>The textured crop haircut is the perfect men's haircut for thick wavy hair in 2023. It is low maintenance, stylish, and easy to style. By following our step-by-step guide and hair care tips, you can keep your hair looking fresh and healthy.
