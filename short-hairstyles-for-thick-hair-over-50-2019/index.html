There are plenty of options to choose from, but it can be overwhelming to decide on one that will flatter your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle. In this post, we'll give you some ideas for short hairstyles for thick hair over 50 that were popular in 2019 and are still going strong in 2023. So, let's get started!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Thick hair can be a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you have a lot of hair to work with, and you can create some incredible styles. On the other hand, it can be difficult to manage, especially if you're not used to having a lot of hair. Short haircuts are a great way to make your thick hair more manageable and give you a fresh, youthful look.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're considering a short hairstyle, the first thing you need to do is find inspiration. Look for pictures of women with hairstyles that you like and save them to your phone or print them out. Then, make an appointment with your hairstylist and bring the pictures with you. Your hairstylist will be able to tell you if the style will work with your hair texture and face shape.</p><h3>Step by step</h3><p>1. Find inspiration</p><p>2. Make an appointment with your hairstylist</p><p>3. Bring pictures of hairstyles you like</p><p>4. Consult with your hairstylist to determine if the style will work with your hair texture and face shape</p><p>5. Get a fresh, youthful look!</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>When choosing a short hairstyle, keep in mind your lifestyle and how much time you're willing to spend styling your hair each day. If you're someone who likes to wash and go, choose a style that's low maintenance. If you're someone who enjoys styling your hair, choose a style that allows for versatility.</p><p>Another tip is to consider your face shape. Some hairstyles may look better on certain face shapes than others. For example, a pixie cut may look great on someone with an oval face, but not as good on someone with a round face.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Q: Will a short hairstyle make me look older?</p><p>A: No, a short hairstyle can actually make you look younger and more vibrant.</p><p>Q: Can I still style my hair if it's short?</p><p>A: Yes, there are plenty of styling options for short hair. You can add volume with a volumizing mousse or create texture with a texturizing spray.</p><p>Q: How often should I get my hair cut?</p><p>A: It depends on how fast your hair grows and how quickly your style loses its shape. Generally, you should get your hair cut every 6-8 weeks to maintain your style.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Short haircuts require minimal maintenance, but that doesn't mean you should neglect your hair. Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and shiny. If you have colored hair, use a color-safe shampoo to prevent fading. Don't forget to use a heat protectant spray if you're using heat styling tools.</p><p>Overall, short hairstyles for thick hair over 50 are a great way to update your look and feel more confident. Choose a style that suits your face shape and lifestyle, and remember to take care of your hair to keep it looking its best. With the right hairstyle and hair care routine, you'll be turning heads in no time!</p></article>
