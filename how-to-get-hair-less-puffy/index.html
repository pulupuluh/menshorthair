Taking care of your hair can go a long way in preventing frizz and puffiness. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfates can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry and prone to frizz.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair too often. Over-washing can also strip your hair of its natural oils, which can lead to dryness and frizz.</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to keep your hair hydrated.</li><li>Avoid towel-drying your hair. Instead, use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to gently squeeze out excess water.</li><li>Avoid using heat tools too often. Heat can damage your hair and make it more prone to frizz.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Get Hair Less Puffy</h2><p>Now that we've covered hair care, let's talk about some ways to get hair less puffy:</p><ul><li>Use a hair serum or cream: Hair serums and creams can help tame frizz and puffiness. Look for products that contain ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, or shea butter.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair with a round brush: Blow-drying your hair with a round brush can help smooth out any puffiness. Start at the roots and work your way down, pulling the brush through your hair as you go.</li><li>Sleep with a silk pillowcase: Silk pillowcases are gentler on your hair than cotton pillowcases, which can cause friction and lead to frizz.</li><li>Try a hair mask: A hair mask can help hydrate your hair and reduce puffiness. Look for masks that contain ingredients like avocado oil, honey, or coconut milk.</li><li>Get a keratin treatment: Keratin treatments can help smooth out frizz and make your hair more manageable. However, they can be expensive and time-consuming.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get hair less puffy:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Apply a hair serum or cream to damp hair, focusing on the ends.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair with a round brush, starting at the roots and working your way down.</li><li>Sleep with a silk pillowcase to prevent frizz.</li><li>Once a week, apply a hair mask to hydrate your hair and reduce puffiness.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Here are some additional tips and tricks for getting hair less puffy:</p><ul><li>Avoid touching your hair too much.
