Massage Your Scalp</h3><p>Massaging your scalp can improve blood flow to your hair follicles, promoting healthy hair growth. Use your fingertips to massage your scalp in a circular motion for a few minutes every day.</p><h3>3. Use Natural Hair Products</h3><p>Using natural hair products can minimize the risk of hair and scalp damage. Look for products that are free from harsh chemicals and additives, such as sulfates and parabens.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: What causes bald patches on the head?</h3><p>A: Bald patches on the head can be caused by a variety of factors, such as genetics, age, stress, and certain medical conditions.</p><h3>Q: Can bald patches on the head be treated?</h3><p>A: Yes, bald patches on the head can be treated depending on the underlying cause.

Protect Your Scalp from the Sun</h3><p>The skin on your scalp can be sensitive to the sun, so it's important to protect it from UV rays.
