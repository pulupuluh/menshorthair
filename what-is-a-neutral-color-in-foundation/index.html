It's right in the middle of the spectrum and is often called a "true neutral" or "balanced" shade. Neutral shades are great for people who have a hard time finding the right foundation match because they don't have obvious undertones.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Find Your Neutral Shade</h3><p>The easiest way to find your neutral shade is to start with a foundation shade that you think might be a good match and compare it to other shades. If the shade you picked looks too yellow or too pink on your skin, it's not a neutral shade. You want to look for a shade that doesn't look too warm or too cool and doesn't change color when it dries down.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>1. Start by selecting a few foundation shades that you think might be a good match. </p><p>2. Apply a small amount of each shade to your jawline or neck. </p><p>3. Look at your skin in natural light and compare each shade to your skin tone. </p><p>4. If a shade looks too yellow or too pink, it's not a neutral shade. </p><p>5. Repeat until you find a shade that looks balanced and doesn't have obvious undertones. </p><h3 id="tips">Tips for Choosing the Right Shade</h3><p>- If you're unsure about your undertones, try a neutral shade first. </p><p>- Always test foundation shades in natural light to get the most accurate match. </p><p>- Don't be afraid to mix shades to get the perfect match. </p><p>- Consider your skin type and the finish of the foundation when choosing a shade. </p><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p>Q: Can I wear a neutral shade if I have warm or cool undertones? </p><p>A: Yes! Neutral shades are great for people who don't have obvious undertones, but they can work for everyone. </p><p>Q: How do I know if a foundation shade is too light or too dark for me? </p><p>A: Test the shade on your jawline and neck and compare it to your natural skin tone. If the shade looks noticeably lighter or darker than your skin tone, it's probably not the right match. </p><h3 id="hair-care">Hair Care and Foundation Shades</h3><p>Believe it or not, your hair color can affect the way foundation shades look on your skin. If you have warm-toned hair (red, orange, or golden), you might want to try a warm-toned foundation shade to complement your hair color. If you have cool-toned hair (ashy blonde, silver, or blue-black), you might want to try a cool-toned foundation shade to balance out your overall look. Neutral shades can work for any hair color, so don't be afraid to experiment!</p><p>Thanks for reading our guide to neutral shades in foundation!
