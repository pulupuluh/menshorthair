Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. This will help to remove any buildup from your hair and make it easier to manage. After washing, towel-dry your hair gently.</p><h3>2. Apply a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Next, apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair. This will help to moisturize your hair and make it easier to detangle.</p><h3>3. Detangle Your Hair</h3><p>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. This will help to prevent any breakage and make it easier to style your hair.</p><h3>4. Apply a Styling Cream</h3><p>Apply a styling cream to your hair. This will help to define your curls and hold them in place. Use your fingers to evenly distribute the product throughout your hair.</p><h3>5. Divide Your Hair into Sections</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections. This will make it easier to style your hair and ensure that each section is evenly curled.</p><h3>6. Curl Your Hair</h3><p>Take a small section of hair and twist it around your finger. Release the curl and clip it in place using a hair clip. Repeat this process until all of your hair is curled.</p><h3>7. Allow Your Hair to Dry</h3><p>Allow your hair to dry naturally. Do not use a hair dryer as this can cause frizz and damage your hair.</p><h3>8. Remove the Hair Clips</h3><p>Once your hair is completely dry, remove the hair clips. Use your fingers to gently separate the curls and create volume.</p><h3>9. Apply a Hair Oil</h3><p>Apply a hair oil to your hair to add shine and lock in moisture.</p><h3>10. Fluff Your Curls</h3><p>Finally, fluff your curls using your fingers.
