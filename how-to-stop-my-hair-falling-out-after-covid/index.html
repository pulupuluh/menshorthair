Make sure you are getting enough vitamins and minerals, such as biotin, vitamin D, and iron, which are essential for healthy hair.</p><h3>3. Take Supplements</h3><p>If you are not getting enough vitamins and minerals from your diet, consider taking supplements. Biotin, vitamin D, and iron supplements can help promote hair growth and prevent hair loss.</p><h3>4.
