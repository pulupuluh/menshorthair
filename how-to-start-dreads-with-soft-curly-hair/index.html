The good news is that it is! In this step by step guide, we'll show you how to start dreads with soft curly hair. We'll also provide tips on how to care for your dreads once they're started.</p><h2>How to Start Dreads with Soft Curly Hair</h2><p>Starting dreadlocks with soft curly hair can be a bit of a challenge, but it's definitely possible. Here are the steps you should follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Decide on the Method</h3><p>There are a few different methods for starting dreadlocks, and some work better for soft curly hair than others. Here are the most common methods:</p><ul><li>Twist and Rip</li><li>Backcombing</li><li>Freeform</li></ul><p>The twist and rip method is a good choice for soft curly hair, as it allows you to create more defined sections. Backcombing can also work, but it's more difficult to get even sections with this method. Freeform is an option, but it may not give you the look you're going for.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've decided on a method, you'll need to section your hair. Use a comb to create even sections. The size of the sections will depend on your preference and the method you're using.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Twisting</h3><p>With the twist and rip method, you'll twist each section of hair and then rip it apart. This will create knots that will eventually turn into dreadlocks. With backcombing, you'll use a comb to backcomb each section of hair, creating knots. Freeform dreads will start to form on their own.</p><h3>Step 4: Palm Roll</h3><p>After you've twisted or backcombed each section of hair, you'll need to palm roll them. This involves rolling the hair between your palms to help the knots form into dreadlocks. Do this regularly to help your dreads mature.</p><h3>Step 5: Be Patient</h3><p>Starting dreadlocks takes time, especially if you have soft curly hair. It can take months or even years for your dreads to fully mature. Be patient and don't get discouraged if your dreads don't look perfect at first.</p><h2>Tips for Starting Dreads with Soft Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you start your dreadlocks:</p><ul><li>Use a residue-free shampoo to avoid buildup</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can slow down the locking process</li><li>Be gentle with your hair to avoid breakage</li><li>Consider using a crochet hook to help tighten your dreads</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I start dreads with soft curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can start dreads with soft curly hair. The process may take longer than it would with straight hair, but it's definitely possible.</p><h3>What's the best method for starting dreads with soft curly hair?</h3><p>The twist and rip method is a good choice for soft curly hair, as it allows you to create more defined sections. Backcombing can also work, but it's more difficult to get even sections with this method. Freeform is an option, but it may not give you the look you're going for.</p><h3>How long does it take for dreads to mature?</h3><p>It can take months or even years for dreads to fully mature.

Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your dreads regularly with a residue-free shampoo</li><li>Be gentle when washing and drying your dreads to avoid breakage</li><li>Avoid using heavy products that can weigh down your dreads</li><li>Consider using a spray bottle to hydrate your scalp and dreads</li></ul><p>Starting dreadlocks with soft curly hair may take some patience and effort, but it's definitely possible.
