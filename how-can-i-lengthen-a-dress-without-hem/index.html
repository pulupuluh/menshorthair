The method you choose will depend on the type of dress you have and how much length you need to add. Here are some of the most popular methods:</p><h3> 1. Add a Lace Border </h3><p>If you have a dress with a straight hemline, you can add a lace border to the bottom of the dress to give it some extra length. To do this, you will need to find a piece of lace that matches the color and style of your dress. Cut the lace to the length you need and sew it onto the bottom of the dress.</p><h3> 2. Add a Ruffle </h3><p>If you have a dress with a flared skirt, you can add a ruffle to the bottom of the dress to give it some extra length.

Cut the fabric into a long strip and sew it onto the bottom of the dress, creating a ruffle.</p><h3> 3. Add a Slip </h3><p>If you have a dress that is too short, you can add a slip underneath to give it some extra length. Choose a slip that matches the color and style of your dress and wear it underneath.</p><h3> 4. Add a Belt </h3><p>If you have a dress that is too short, you can add a belt to the waistline to give it some extra length.
