Look no further because we've got you covered. In this guide, we'll share the best hairstyle ideas for long oval face male that will make you look your best. Read on to find out more.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Long oval face males have a face shape that is longer than it is wide. This face shape is characterized by a high forehead, prominent cheekbones, and a narrow chin. The best hairstyles for long oval face males are those that add width to the face, balance out the proportions, and draw attention away from the length of the face.</p><h2>How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>Before we dive into the best hairstyle ideas for long oval face male, let's first determine if you have a long oval face shape. Here's how:</p><h3>Step 1: Measure Your Face</h3><p>Use a measuring tape or ruler to measure the following:</p><ul><li>Forehead: Measure across the widest part of your forehead, typically just above your eyebrows.</li><li>Cheekbones: Measure across your cheekbones, starting and ending at the pointiest part below the outer corner of each eye.</li><li>Jawline: Measure from the tip of your chin to the point below your ear where your jaw angles upward. Multiply that number by two to get your jawline measurement.</li><li>Face length: Measure from the center of your hairline to the tip of your chin.</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>Compare your measurements using the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>Oval: Your face length is larger than the width of your cheekbones, and your forehead is larger than your jawline.</li><li>Round: Your face length and cheekbones are roughly equal, and your forehead and jawline are also roughly equal.</li><li>Square: Your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are roughly equal in width.</li><li>Heart: Your forehead is wider than your cheekbones and jawline, and your chin comes to a point.</li><li>Diamond: Your cheekbones are the widest part of your face, and your forehead and jawline are narrower.</li><li>Triangle: Your jawline is wider than your forehead and cheekbones.</li></ul><h2>Best Hairstyle Ideas for Long Oval Face Male</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, let's take a look at the best hairstyle ideas for long oval face male:</p><h3>1.

Textured Quiff</h3><p>A textured quiff is a stylish and modern hairstyle that works well for long oval face males.

Slicked Back Hair</h3><p>Slicked back hair is a classic and sophisticated hairstyle that can work well for long oval face males. The slicked back style adds width to the face and creates a sleek and polished look. Use a strong hold gel or pomade to keep the hair in place.</p><h3>5. Messy Crop</h3><p>A messy crop is a low-maintenance and stylish hairstyle that works well for long oval face males. The messy texture adds volume and creates a relaxed and casual look. Use a texturizing product to create the messy texture.</p><h2>Tips for Styling Your Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when styling your hair:</p><ul><li>Use a hair product that works well for your hair type and the hairstyle you want to achieve.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair in the direction you want it to go to create volume and hold.</li><li>Experiment with different hairstyles to find the one that works best for you.</li><li>Maintain your hairstyle by getting regular haircuts and trims.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the best hairstyle for long oval face male:</p><h3>What is the best haircut for a long oval face male?</h3><p>The best haircut for a long oval face male is one that adds width to the face and balances out the proportions.
