If you're looking to change up your hairstyle this year, or just need some inspiration, we've got you covered. In this article, we'll be discussing the latest trends and styles for medium length hair, as well as providing tips on how to maintain and care for your new look. So, let's dive in! </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li> Introduction </li><li> The Classic Side Part </li><li> The Messy Textured Look </li><li> The Modern Pompadour </li><li> The Shag </li><li> The French Crop </li><li> The Buzz Cut </li><li> How to Choose the Right Style for You </li><li> Tips for Maintaining Your Medium Length Hair </li><li> Frequently Asked Questions </li><li> Conclusion </li></ul><h2> The Classic Side Part </h2><p> The classic side part is a timeless style that has been around for decades. This look is perfect for the modern man who wants a stylish, yet professional appearance. To achieve this look, you'll want to start by parting your hair on one side, then using a comb to smooth your hair down on the other side. You can choose to keep your hair short and tidy, or add some length and texture for a more relaxed vibe. </p><p> One of the great things about the classic side part is that it's versatile enough to work with any face shape or hair type. Whether you have straight, curly, or wavy hair, this style can be adapted to suit your needs. Plus, it's low maintenance and easy to style, making it a great choice for busy guys on-the-go. </p><h2> The Messy Textured Look </h2><p> If you're looking for a more laid-back style, the messy textured look could be just what you need. This style is all about creating a natural, undone look that's effortless and cool. To achieve this look, you'll want to start by adding some texture to your hair with a styling product, such as a texturizing spray or pomade. Then, use your fingers to tousle your hair and create a messy, bedhead look. </p><p> The messy textured look is perfect for guys who want a casual, carefree style that's easy to maintain. It works particularly well for guys with wavy or curly hair, as the texture adds definition and volume. However, even if you have straight hair, you can still achieve this look with the right products and styling techniques. </p><h2> The Modern Pompadour </h2><p> The modern pompadour is a sleek, sophisticated style that's perfect for guys who want a polished, refined look. This style is characterized by its high volume on top, with shorter sides and back. To achieve the modern pompadour, you'll need to have some length on top, as well as a good styling product, such as a pomade or wax. </p><p> To style the modern pompadour, start by applying your product to damp hair, then blow-dry your hair upwards and back to create volume. Use a comb to smooth your hair down on the sides and back, then use your fingers to style the top into the classic pompadour shape. </p><h2> The Shag </h2><p> The shag is a classic style that's been around since the 1970s. This look is all about creating a messy, layered look that's relaxed and cool. To achieve the shag, you'll need to have some length on top, as well as layers throughout your hair. </p><p> To style the shag, use a texturizing spray or pomade to add some texture to your hair, then use your fingers to tousle and shape your hair into the desired style. The shag works particularly well for guys with wavy or curly hair, as the layers add movement and definition. </p><h2> The French Crop </h2><p> The French crop is a sleek, modern style that's perfect for guys who want a short, low maintenance look. This style is characterized by its short sides and back, with slightly longer hair on top that's styled forward. To achieve the French crop, you'll need to have a good barber who can create the right shape and length for your hair. </p><p> To style the French crop, use a matte styling product, such as a clay or paste, to add some texture and hold to your hair. Then, use your fingers to style your hair forward, creating a natural, tousled look. </p><h2> The Buzz Cut </h2><p> The buzz cut is a classic style that's been around for decades. This look is all about creating a clean, sharp look that's low maintenance and easy to style. To achieve the buzz cut, you'll need to have your hair cut very short all over, usually with clippers. </p><p> To style the buzz cut, simply use a small amount of styling product, such as a pomade or wax, to add some shine and hold to your hair. Use your fingers to style your hair into the desired shape, or simply leave it as is for a natural, no-fuss look. </p><h2> How to Choose the Right Style for You </h2><p> When choosing a medium length haircut, it's important to consider your face shape, hair type, and personal style. If you have a round face, for example, you may want to avoid styles that add too much volume on top, as this can make your face appear even rounder. If you have curly hair, on the other hand, you may want to consider styles that add definition and volume, as this can enhance your natural texture. </p><p> It's also important to consider your lifestyle and personal style when choosing a haircut. If you're a busy guy who doesn't have a lot of time to style your hair, you may want to opt for a low maintenance style, such as the buzz cut or French crop. If you're more of a fashion-forward guy, on the other hand, you may want to consider a more trendy style, such as the modern pompadour or messy textured look. </p><h2> Tips for Maintaining Your Medium Length Hair </h2><p> Once you've chosen your medium length haircut, it's important to maintain and care for your hair to keep it looking its best. Here are some tips to help you keep your hair looking great: </p><ul><li> Wash your hair regularly, but don't overdo it. Over-washing can strip your hair of its natural oils, causing it to dry out and become brittle. </li><li> Use a conditioner to keep your hair soft and smooth. Look for a conditioner that's designed for your hair type, whether it's curly, straight, or wavy. </li><li> Use a styling product to add texture, hold, and shine to your hair. Choose a product that's appropriate for your hair type and the style you're trying to achieve. </li><li> Get regular haircuts to maintain the shape and length of your hair. How often you need to get a haircut will depend on your hair type and the style you're trying to achieve. </li><li> Protect your hair from damage by using a heat protectant spray before using hot tools, such as a blow dryer or straightener. </li></ul><h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2><h3> Q: What is the best haircut for medium length hair? </h3><p> A: The best haircut for medium length hair will depend on your face shape, hair type, and personal style.
