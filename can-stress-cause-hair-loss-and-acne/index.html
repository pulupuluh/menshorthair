When we encounter stress, our bodies release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline to help us cope. However, chronic stress can have negative effects on our health. Stress can manifest in physical symptoms such as headaches, muscle tension, and fatigue, as well as emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression.</p><h2 id="can-stress-cause-hair-loss">Can Stress Cause Hair Loss?</h2><p>Yes, stress can cause hair loss. The medical term for stress-related hair loss is telogen effluvium. This condition occurs when stress causes hair follicles to enter a resting phase, which leads to increased hair shedding. Telogen effluvium typically occurs 2-3 months after a stressful event and can last for several months.</p><p>If you're experiencing hair loss due to stress, it's important to address the underlying cause of your stress. This may involve seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, or making lifestyle changes to reduce stress levels.</p><h2 id="can-stress-cause-acne">Can Stress Cause Acne?</h2><p>Yes, stress can cause acne. When we're stressed, our bodies release cortisol, which can increase oil production in the skin. This can lead to clogged pores and acne breakouts. Stress can also worsen existing acne by triggering inflammation in the skin.</p><p>If you're experiencing stress-related acne, it's important to take steps to manage your stress levels. This may involve practicing stress-reducing activities such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. You may also want to consider seeking professional help if your stress levels are impacting your daily life.</p><h2 id="how-to-manage-stress-related-hair-loss-and-acne">How to Manage Stress-Related Hair Loss and Acne</h2><p>If you're experiencing hair loss or acne due to stress, there are several steps you can take to manage these symptoms:</p><h3>1.
