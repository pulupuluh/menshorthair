In most cases, hormonal changes and stress during pregnancy are the main culprits.

Once you have identified the cause of your hair fall, you can take the necessary steps to reverse it.</p><h3>1. Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>One of the best ways to reduce hair fall after pregnancy is to eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals that promote hair growth.

Take Supplements</h3><p>In addition to eating a balanced diet, taking supplements can also help reduce hair fall after pregnancy.

Manage Stress</h3><p>Stress is a major contributor to hair fall after pregnancy.

If you must use them, use a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from damage.</p><h3>5.
