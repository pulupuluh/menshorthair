With hair salons closed or operating at reduced capacity, many people have been forced to cut their own hair at home. If you're in the same boat, don't worry – cutting your own hair isn't as difficult as it may seem. With the right tools and technique, you can give yourself a decent haircut that will hold you over until you can visit a professional stylist again.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut Your Own Hair During COVID-19</h2><p>If you're thinking about cutting your own hair, there are a few things you'll need to purchase first. You'll need a pair of sharp haircutting scissors, a comb, and hair clips. You may also want to invest in a handheld mirror so you can see the back of your head.</p><h3>Step by Step Guide</h3><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to cutting your own hair:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, damp hair. It's best to cut your hair when it's clean and slightly damp. This will make it easier to see the natural shape of your hair.</li><li>Section your hair. Use hair clips to section your hair into four parts – front, sides, and back. This will make it easier to cut each section evenly.</li><li>Start with the front section. Comb your hair straight down and trim the ends with scissors. Cut a small amount at first, then gradually cut more if needed.</li><li>Move to the sides. Comb the hair straight down and trim the ends. Be sure to cut each side evenly.</li><li>Cut the back. This can be tricky, especially if you don't have a handheld mirror. If you have a friend or family member who can help, ask them to check the back of your hair and guide you as you cut.</li><li>Blend the layers. Use the scissors to blend the layers together, so they look natural and not choppy.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips for a Successful Haircut</h3><p>Here are some tips to help you get a successful haircut:</p><ul><li>Take your time. Cutting your own hair may take longer than you expect, so be patient and don't rush.</li><li>Start with small cuts. It's always better to cut less hair than you think you need. You can always cut more later if you need to.</li><li>Use good lighting. Make sure you're cutting your hair in a well-lit area, so you can see what you're doing.</li><li>Watch tutorials. If you're feeling nervous, there are plenty of tutorials online that can guide you through the process.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting your own hair:</p><ul><li>Q: Can I use regular scissors to cut my hair?</li><li>A: No, it's best to use haircutting scissors, which are sharper and designed specifically for cutting hair.</li><li>Q: How often should I cut my hair?</li><li>A: It depends on your hair type and how quickly it grows. Generally, it's recommended to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to keep it healthy.</li><li>Q: What should I do if I make a mistake?</li><li>A: Don't panic! Mistakes happen. If you make a mistake, try to even it out with the other side or wait for it to grow out.</li></ul><h3 id="hair-care">Hair Care after Cutting</h3><p>After you've finished cutting your hair, it's important to take good care of it. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, like blow dryers, straighteners, and curling irons, which can damage your hair.</li><li>Use hair masks and treatments to keep your hair healthy and strong.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends.</li></ul><p>Remember, cutting your own hair can be a daunting task, but with the right tools and technique, it's definitely doable. Just take your time, be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if it's not perfect. At the end of the day, it's just hair – it will grow back!</p></article>
