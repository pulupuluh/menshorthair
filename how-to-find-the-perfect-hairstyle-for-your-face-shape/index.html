There are six different face shapes, including round, oval, square, heart, diamond, and oblong. Here's how to determine your face shape:</p><h3>Round Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a round face shape, your face is as wide as it is long. Your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all about the same width. Your chin is slightly rounded, and your face is typically soft with no sharp angles.</p><h3>Oval Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oval face shape, your face is longer than it is wide. Your forehead is slightly wider than your chin, and your face tapers down to a narrow oval chin. Your cheekbones are high and well-defined.</p><h3>Square Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a square face shape, your face is as wide as it is long, but with a strong, angular jawline. Your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all about the same width.</p><h3>Heart Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a heart face shape, your forehead is wider than your cheeks and jawline. Your chin is pointed, and your face tapers down to a narrow point at the bottom.</p><h3>Diamond Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a diamond face shape, your face is widest at the cheekbones, and your forehead and jawline are narrower. Your chin is pointed.</p><h3>Oblong Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oblong face shape, your face is longer than it is wide. Your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all about the same width.
