Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>Your diet plays a crucial role in hair health.

Avoid using hot styling tools like curling irons and straighteners, as they can damage your hair and make hair loss worse.</p><h3>4.

Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.</p><h3>5. Take Supplements</h3><p>You can take supplements to promote healthy hair growth.
