One of the most iconic hairstyles of the era is the voluminous, bouncy curls. If you want to channel your inner 60s diva, we’ve got you covered. In this article, we’ll show you how to curl your hair 60s style. Get ready to turn heads with your retro-inspired curls!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 60s were a time of revolution, and this was reflected in the fashion and hairstyles of the time. Women embraced their natural hair textures and experimented with new styles. One of the most popular hairstyles of the era was big, bouncy curls. This style was achieved with curling irons, rollers, and lots of hairspray. Today, the 60s style is still popular, and you can recreate it at home with a few simple steps.</p><h2>How to Curl Hair 60s Style: Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Prep your hair</h3><p>Before you start curling your hair, you need to prepare it. Start by washing your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Towel dry your hair and apply a heat protectant spray. This will protect your hair from heat damage caused by the curling iron.</p><h3>Step 2: Section your hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small sections. The size of the sections will depend on the thickness of your hair. If you have thick hair, you may need to section it into smaller sections. Use clips to secure the sections.</p><h3>Step 3: Curl your hair</h3><p>Take a small section of hair and wrap it around the curling iron. Hold the curling iron in place for a few seconds, then release the curl. Repeat this process on all sections of hair until your entire head is curled.</p><h3>Step 4: Brush out your curls</h3><p>Once your curls have cooled down, use a brush to gently brush them out. This will give your curls a softer, more natural look.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>To keep your curls in place, finish with a light mist of hairspray. This will also add shine and hold to your hair.</p><h2>Tips for Curling Hair 60s Style</h2><p>To achieve the perfect 60s curls, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Use a curling iron with a large barrel to create big, bouncy curls.</li><li>Start curling your hair at the back of your head and work your way towards the front.</li><li>Don’t curl your hair all the way to the ends. Leave the last inch or so uncurled for a more natural look.</li><li>Use a light touch when brushing out your curls. You don’t want to brush them out completely.</li><li>Finish with a light mist of hairspray to hold your curls in place.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I use rollers instead of a curling iron?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can use rollers to achieve 60s-style curls. Rollers will give you a softer, more natural look. Just make sure to use a setting lotion to help your curls hold their shape.</p><h3>Q: What kind of hairspray should I use?</h3><p>A: Use a light-hold hairspray to keep your curls in place without weighing them down. Avoid heavy, sticky hairsprays that can make your hair look stiff and unnatural.</p><h3>Q: How long will my curls last?</h3><p>A: Your curls should last all day if you use a heat protectant spray and a light-hold hairspray.</p><h2>Hair Care for 60s-Style Curls</h2><p>To keep your 60s-style curls looking their best, here are some hair care tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every other day to avoid stripping it of its natural oils.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as this can damage your hair.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends and breakage.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to curl your hair 60s style, it’s time to rock those retro-inspired curls. Whether you’re going for a casual look or a glamorous evening style, 60s curls are sure to turn heads. So grab your curling iron and get ready to embrace your inner 60s diva!</p></article>
