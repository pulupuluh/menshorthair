If you're wondering how to keep your permed hair looking its best, you're in the right place. Here, we'll go over some tips and tricks to help you maintain your permed hair and keep it looking fabulous. </p><h2> How to Keep Your Permed Hair </h2><p> If you want to keep your permed hair looking great, you'll need to take some extra steps to care for it. Here are some tips to help you get started: </p><h3> 1. Moisturize Your Hair </h3><p> Perming can be harsh on your hair, so it's important to keep it moisturized. Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and hydrated. </p><h3> 2. Avoid Heat </h3><p> Heat can damage your permed hair, so it's important to avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons. If you need to style your hair, use a diffuser on your blow dryer to help define your curls. </p><h3> 3. Use the Right Hair Products </h3><p> Using the right hair products can make a big difference in how your permed hair looks and feels. Look for products that are specifically designed for permed hair, like curl-enhancing shampoos and conditioners. </p><h3> 4. Protect Your Hair </h3><p> When you're sleeping or swimming, it's important to protect your permed hair. Wear a silk or satin bonnet to bed to prevent frizz, and wear a swim cap when you're in the pool to protect your hair from chlorine. </p><h2> Step by Step Guide to Keep Your Permed Hair </h2><h3> Step 1: Wash Your Hair </h3><p> Start by washing your hair with a curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner. This will help define your curls and keep your hair healthy. </p><h3> Step 2: Apply Deep Conditioning Treatment </h3><p> Once a week, apply a deep conditioning treatment to your hair to keep it moisturized and healthy. Leave the treatment on for at least 10 minutes, then rinse it out with cool water. </p><h3> Step 3: Don't Use Heat </h3><p> Avoid using heat on your permed hair, as it can damage your curls. If you need to style your hair, use a diffuser on your blow dryer to help define your curls. </p><h3> Step 4: Use the Right Hair Products </h3><p> Look for hair products that are specifically designed for permed hair, like curl-enhancing shampoos and conditioners.

Don't Brush Your Hair </h3><p> Brushing your permed hair can cause frizz and damage your curls. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair. </p><h3> 2. Don't Overwash Your Hair </h3><p> Overwashing your hair can strip it of its natural oils and cause it to become dry and brittle. Wash your hair every other day, or even less often if your hair is particularly dry. </p><h3> 3. Get Regular Trims </h3><p> Getting regular trims can help keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends. Aim to get a trim every six to eight weeks. </p><h2> FAQs About Permed Hair </h2><h3> Q: How long does a perm last? </h3><p> A: A perm can last anywhere from three to six months, depending on how fast your hair grows and how well you take care of it. </p><h3> Q: Can I color my permed hair? </h3><p> A: Yes, you can color your permed hair, but it's important to wait at least two weeks after your perm before coloring your hair. </p><h3> Q: Can I swim with permed hair? </h3><p> A: Yes, you can swim with permed hair, but it's important to wear a swim cap to protect your hair from chlorine. </p><h2> Hair Care for Permed Hair </h2><p> Perming your hair can be a great way to add some volume and texture, but it also requires some extra care.
