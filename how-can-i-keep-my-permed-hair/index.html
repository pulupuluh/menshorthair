If you're wondering how to keep your permed hair looking its best, you're in the right place. Here, we'll go over some tips and tricks to help you maintain your permed hair and keep it looking fabulous. </p><h2> How to Keep Your Permed Hair </h2><p> If you want to keep your permed hair looking great, you'll need to take some extra steps to care for it. Here are some tips to help you get started: </p><h3> 1. Moisturize Your Hair </h3><p> Perming can be harsh on your hair, so it's important to keep it moisturized. Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and hydrated. </p><h3> 2. Avoid Heat </h3><p> Heat can damage your permed hair, so it's important to avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons. If you need to style your hair, use a diffuser on your blow dryer to help define your curls. </p><h3> 3. Use the Right Hair Products </h3><p> Using the right hair products can make a big difference in how your permed hair looks and feels. Look for products that are specifically designed for permed hair, like curl-enhancing shampoos and conditioners. </p><h3> 4. Protect Your Hair </h3><p> When you're sleeping or swimming, it's important to protect your permed hair. Wear a silk or satin bonnet to bed to prevent frizz, and wear a swim cap when you're in the pool to protect your hair from chlorine. </p><h2> Step by Step Guide to Keep Your Permed Hair </h2><h3> Step 1: Wash Your Hair </h3><p> Start by washing your hair with a curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner. This will help define your curls and keep your hair healthy. </p><h3> Step 2: Apply Deep Conditioning Treatment </h3><p> Once a week, apply a deep conditioning treatment to your hair to keep it moisturized and healthy.
