Some common causes of hair loss include genetics, age, hormonal changes, stress, and certain medications or medical conditions.</p><p>If you're concerned that you may be losing your hair, there are several signs to look out for. In this article, we'll explore the different ways to tell if you're losing your hair and what you can do about it.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The first step in determining if you're losing your hair is to pay attention to how much hair you're losing each day.
