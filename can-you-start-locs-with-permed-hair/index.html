This is a common question that many people have when considering locs. The good news is that it is possible to start locs with permed hair, but there are a few things you need to consider before getting started.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Locs are a popular hairstyle that involves allowing your hair to grow and naturally lock together over time. Perming your hair involves chemically altering the texture of your hair to make it curly or wavy. While permed hair can be a great way to switch up your hairstyle, it can also make it more difficult to start locs since the texture of your hair is altered.</p><h2>How to Start Locs with Permed Hair</h2><p>Starting locs with permed hair requires a bit of patience and some special considerations. Here are the steps you need to take:</p><h3>1. Wait until your hair has grown out a bit</h3><p>Before starting locs with permed hair, it is important to wait until your hair has grown out a bit. This will make it easier to work with and will help your locs to form more quickly.</p><h3>2. Stop perming your hair</h3><p>If you are serious about starting locs, you will need to stop perming your hair. This is because perming your hair can make it more difficult for your locs to form and can also weaken your hair.</p><h3>3. Consider doing a big chop</h3><p>If you have a lot of permed hair, you may want to consider doing a big chop. This involves cutting off all of your permed hair and starting fresh with a shorter hairstyle. While this may seem drastic, it can make it easier to start locs and can also help to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>4. Consult with a professional stylist</h3><p>Consulting with a professional stylist who has experience working with locs and permed hair can be helpful. They can give you advice on how to care for your hair and can also help you to start your locs.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can permed hair be locked?</h3><p>Yes, permed hair can be locked, but it can be more difficult to start locs with permed hair due to the altered texture of the hair.</p><h3>How long does it take to start locs with permed hair?</h3><p>The time it takes to start locs with permed hair can vary depending on the length and texture of your hair. It can take anywhere from several months to a year or longer to start your locs.</p><h3>Can I wash my hair while starting locs with permed hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can wash your hair while starting locs with permed hair. It is important to use a gentle shampoo and to avoid using heavy products that can weigh down your hair.</p><h2>Tips for Starting Locs with Permed Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when starting locs with permed hair:</p><ul><li>Be patient - starting locs takes time and it may take longer with permed hair</li><li>Avoid using heavy products that can weigh down your hair</li><li>Consider using a natural oil like coconut oil to help moisturize your hair</li><li>Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy</li></ul><h2>Hair Care for Permed Hair and Locs</h2><p>Whether you have permed hair or locs, it is important to take good care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best.
