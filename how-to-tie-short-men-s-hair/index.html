Use bobby pins to tuck in any loose hair strands. <h3>The Half-Up Half-Down</h3> The half-up half-down hairstyle is an excellent option if you want to keep your hair out of your face but still show off your locks. Here's how to do it: 1. Brush your hair backward to remove any knots or tangles. 2. Gather the top half of your hair and hold it with one hand. 3. Use the other hand to wrap an elastic band around the hair to create a half-ponytail. 4. Use bobby pins to tuck in any loose hair strands. <h3>The Top Knot</h3> The top knot is a variation of the man bun and is ideal for those with longer hair on top. Here's how to create a top knot: 1.
