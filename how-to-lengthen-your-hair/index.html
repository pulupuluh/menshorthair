Use your fingertips to gently massage your scalp for a few minutes each day.</p><h3>4. Try hair growth products</h3><p>There are many hair growth products on the market, such as shampoos and oils, that claim to promote hair growth. While there is no guarantee that these products will work, they may be worth a try.</p><h3>5.

Look for products that contain natural ingredients and have good reviews.</p><h3>How often should I wash my hair?</h3><p>It's recommended to wash your hair no more than twice a week to prevent stripping it of its natural oils.
