These scissors have a rounded tip to prevent accidental cuts and are sharp enough to easily cut through your dog's hair.</li><br/><li>Prepare Your Dog: Before you start cutting your dog's hair, you need to make sure they are comfortable and calm. Give them a bath and brush their hair to remove any tangles or mats. You can also give them a treat to help them relax.</li><br/><li>Start with the Legs: Begin by trimming your dog's leg hair. Use the scissors to trim the hair around the paws, making sure to cut the hair between the paw pads.

Use the scissors to trim the hair on your dog's back, sides, and belly.
