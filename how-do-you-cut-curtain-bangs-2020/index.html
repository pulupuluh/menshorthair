This style, which was popularized in the 1970s and has made a comeback in recent years, features long, wispy bangs that are parted down the middle, framing the face on either side. In this article, we'll show you how to cut curtain bangs 2020 style, so you can rock this chic look with confidence.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Curtain bangs are a low-maintenance hairstyle that can be worn by people of all hair types and lengths. They are particularly flattering for those with round or oval face shapes, as they help to elongate the face and create a more angular appearance. Curtain bangs can be styled in a variety of ways, from straight and sleek to tousled and textured, making them a versatile choice for any occasion.</p><h2>How to Cut Curtain Bangs 2020: Step-by-Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Supplies</h3><p>Before you start cutting, you'll need to gather a few essential supplies. These include:</p><ul><li>Sharp scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Sectioning clips</li><li>Haircutting cape or towel</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair as you normally would, making sure it is completely dry before you start cutting. Comb your hair straight back from your forehead, so that it is out of the way and you can focus on your bangs.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Bangs</h3><p>Use your comb to create a middle part in your hair, from the center of your forehead to the crown of your head. Then, section off the hair that you want to become your bangs. Depending on how thick you want your bangs to be, you can take a small or large section of hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut Your Bangs</h3><p>Now it's time to start cutting! Holding your scissors at a slight angle, cut into your bangs vertically, using a feathering technique. This will create a soft, wispy effect. Cut your bangs to the desired length, keeping in mind that they will appear shorter once they are dry.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Bangs</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting, it's time to style your bangs. Use a round brush to blow dry them, pulling them to either side of your face to create the curtain effect. You can also add some texture by using a curling iron or flat iron to create loose waves or curls.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting Curtain Bangs 2020</h2><p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind when cutting your curtain bangs:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer length, as you can always go back and cut more if needed.</li><li>Don't cut too much at once, as this can result in a choppy or uneven look.</li><li>Use a mirror to check your progress as you go.</li><li>Remember that your bangs will appear shorter once they are dry, so err on the side of caution when cutting.</li><li>If you're unsure about cutting your own bangs, it's always a good idea to visit a professional stylist.</li></ul><h2>Curtain Bangs 2020: FAQ</h2><h3>How often do I need to trim my curtain bangs?</h3><p>It's recommended to trim your bangs every 4-6 weeks to maintain their shape and length.</p><h3>Can I wear curtain bangs with any hair type?</h3><p>Yes, curtain bangs can be worn by people with straight, wavy, or curly hair. However, the thickness and texture of your hair may affect the way your bangs look, so it's important to choose a style that works with your natural hair type.</p><h3>Do I need to use any special products to style my curtain bangs?</h3><p>Not necessarily. However, using a heat protectant spray before using hot tools can help to prevent damage to your hair. You can also use a texturizing spray or pomade to add definition and hold to your bangs.</p><h2>Caring for Your Curtain Bangs</h2><p>To keep your curtain bangs looking their best, it's important to care for them properly. Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools too often, as this can cause damage to your hair.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair, starting at the ends and working your way up.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and other environmental factors by wearing a hat or scarf.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and using the right techniques, you can achieve the perfect curtain bangs 2020 style that will flatter your face and make a statement everywhere you go. Happy cutting!</p></article>
