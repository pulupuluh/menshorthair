Do you want to change your hairstyle without going to the salon? Cutting your hair at home may seem intimidating, but with the right tools and techniques, it can be easy and fun. This article will guide you through the process of cutting medium length wavy hair at home.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Medium length wavy hair can be challenging to style, but it is also versatile and trendy. The length ranges from the collarbone to the shoulder blades, and the waves can be loose or tight. Cutting wavy hair requires precision and patience, as the waves can affect the length and volume of the hair. However, by following these steps and tips, you can achieve a fresh and chic haircut.</p><h2>How to</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather your tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have the necessary tools: scissors, comb, hair clips, and mirror. Choose sharp scissors that are designed for cutting hair, as dull scissors can damage your hair and cause split ends. Also, make sure you have good lighting and a clear space to work in.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner, and let it air dry or blow-dry it. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start cutting, as wet hair can stretch and appear longer than it actually is. Use a comb to detangle your hair and remove any knots or tangles.</p><h3>Step 3: Section your hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using hair clips. Start by parting your hair down the middle, and then create two sections on each side of your head. Clip each section separately, leaving the top section for last.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the bottom layer</h3><p>Start cutting the bottom layer of your hair. Take a small section of hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers, and cut it straight across. Repeat this process for each section, working your way around your head. Be careful not to cut too much hair, as you can always cut more later.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the top layer</h3><p>Once you have cut the bottom layer, unclip the top section of your hair. Comb it straight down, and then cut it at an angle. This will create layers and add volume to your hair. Start by cutting a small section, and then work your way around your head. Make sure the layers are blended and even.</p><h3>Step 6: Check the length</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting your hair, check the length and make sure it is even. Use a mirror to see the back of your head, and make any necessary adjustments. If you want shorter hair, you can repeat the process and cut more hair.</p><h3>Tips</h3><p>- Start with small sections of hair and cut slowly. It is better to cut less than to cut too much.</p><p>- Use a comb to guide your scissors and keep the hair straight.</p><p>- Cut your hair when it is dry, as wet hair can be harder to cut and style.</p><p>- If you have curly hair, cut your hair when it is in its natural state, as curly hair can shrink when it dries.</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p>Q: Can I cut my hair with regular scissors?</p><p>A: No, regular scissors can damage your hair and cause split ends. Use scissors that are specifically designed for cutting hair.</p><p>Q: How often should I cut my hair?</p><p>A: It depends on your hair type and length. Generally, it is recommended to cut your hair every 6-8 weeks to maintain healthy hair.</p><h3>Hair Care</h3><p>After you have cut your hair, it is important to take care of it to maintain its health and shine. Use a good shampoo and conditioner that are suitable for your hair type. Avoid using heat tools such as flat irons and curling irons, as they can damage your hair. Instead, let your hair air dry or use a diffuser. Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends and maintain its shape.</p><p>Cutting your medium length wavy hair at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. By following these steps and tips, you can achieve a stylish and professional-looking haircut. Remember to take your time and be patient, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Good luck!</p></article>
