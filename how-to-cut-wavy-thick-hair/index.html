The key is to work with the natural texture of your hair and use the right tools and techniques. Here are some steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Start with dry hair</h3><p>It's important to cut wavy hair when it's dry, as wet hair can be misleading when it comes to length and texture. So make sure your hair is completely dry before you begin.</p><h3>2. Section your hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections, starting at the back of your head and working your way forward. Use clips to secure each section, so you can focus on one area at a time.</p><h3>3. Cut the length</h3><p>Using sharp hair cutting scissors, trim the ends of each section of hair to the desired length. Be sure to cut small amounts at a time, as it's easier to cut more hair later than to put it back on once it's cut.</p><h3>4. Add layers</h3><p>To add volume and texture to your wavy hair, you can add layers. Start with the top layer of hair and cut it at an angle, working your way down to the bottom layer. Be sure to blend the layers together for a seamless look.</p><h3>5. Check for balance</h3><p>After you've finished cutting your hair, check for balance by comparing the length and layers on both sides of your head. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure your hair is symmetrical.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you're still unsure about how to cut your wavy thick hair, here's a step-by-step guide to follow:</p><h3>1.
