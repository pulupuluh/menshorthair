This is a common hair type, and it is known as the "mixed texture" hair. It can be challenging to manage as the hair has different textures, which require different styling techniques. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at why your hair is wavy on top and straight underneath and how you can manage it.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The first step in managing mixed texture hair is to understand why it occurs. The top layer of your hair is exposed to more sunlight, heat, and styling products than the underside. This exposure can cause the hair to become wavy or curly, while the hair underneath remains straight. Genetics can also play a role in this hair type, as some people are simply born with mixed texture hair.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h3><p>If you have mixed texture hair, there are several steps you can take to manage it:</p><ol><li>Start by using a shampoo and conditioner designed for your hair type. Look for products that are specifically formulated for mixed texture hair, as they will provide the moisture and nourishment your hair needs.</li><li>When styling your hair, use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage from hot tools. This is especially important for the top layer of your hair, which is more prone to heat damage.</li><li>If you want to enhance your natural waves, try using a curl-enhancing product. Apply it to damp hair and scrunch your hair to create waves. Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser on low heat.</li><li>If you prefer straight hair, use a straightening serum or cream to smooth out the top layer of your hair. Use a flat iron to straighten your hair, starting at the roots and working your way down.</li><li>Regular trims are important for mixed texture hair, as they help to prevent split ends and keep your hair looking healthy.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3><p>Here are a few additional tips for managing mixed texture hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it is wet, as this can cause breakage and frizz. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair.</li><li>Avoid using heavy styling products, as they can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li><li>If you have curly/wavy hair, use a microfiber towel or t-shirt to dry your hair. Regular towels can cause frizz and breakage.</li><li>If you have straight hair, avoid using too much product, as it can make your hair look greasy and heavy.</li><li>Consider getting a hair cut that complements your hair type. A layered cut can help to blend the different textures of your hair.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3><p>Here are a few frequently asked questions about mixed texture hair:</p><ul><li>Can mixed texture hair be straightened? Yes, mixed texture hair can be straightened. Use a straightening serum or cream to smooth out the top layer of your hair, and use a flat iron to straighten your hair.</li><li>Can mixed texture hair be styled?
