The style involves parting the hair in a butterfly shape and then wrapping the hair around itself to create a wavy, textured look. The hair used for butterfly locs can be synthetic or human hair, but it is important to choose high-quality hair that will not easily tangle or shed.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Achieve Butterfly Locs</h2><p>Before discussing which hair is best for butterfly locs, it is important to understand the basic process for achieving this hairstyle. Here is a quick overview:</p><ol><li>Start by washing and conditioning your hair.</li><li>Section your hair into small, butterfly-shaped parts.</li><li>Wrap each section of hair around itself to create a twisted, loc-like effect.</li><li>Continue this process until all of your hair is twisted into locs.</li><li>Style your locs as desired.</li></ol><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a more detailed step-by-step guide for achieving butterfly locs:</p><ol><li>Start by washing and conditioning your hair.

Use a comb to create a part down the center of your head, and then create two more diagonal parts on either side of the center part. This should create a butterfly-shaped parting.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from one of the butterfly-shaped parts and begin twisting it around itself.
