When you rub a balloon on your hair, for example, electrons are transferred from your hair to the balloon, leaving your hair with a positive charge. This positive charge causes your hair strands to repel each other, resulting in the "standing up" effect.</p><h3>Goosebumps</h3><p>Goosebumps are caused by the contraction of tiny muscles at the base of each hair follicle. This contraction causes the hair to stand up, creating a small bump on the skin. Goosebumps are often associated with cold temperatures, but they can also be triggered by strong emotions like fear or excitement.</p><h3>Fear or Anxiety</h3><p>When you experience fear or anxiety, your body releases adrenaline and other stress hormones. These hormones can cause the muscles at the base of your hair follicles to contract, resulting in the "hair standing on end" sensation.</p><h3>Cold Temperature</h3><p>When you're exposed to cold temperatures, your body tries to conserve heat by constricting blood vessels near the skin's surface.
