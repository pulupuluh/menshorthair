This will add some texture and volume to your curls, which will make them appear shorter. Talk to your hairstylist about the best type of layering for your hair type and face shape.</p><h3>Diffusing</h3><p>Diffusing your hair is another great way to make your curls appear shorter. After washing your hair, use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair without disturbing your curls too much. This will help your curls keep their shape and appear shorter.</p><h3>Pulling the Curls Apart</h3><p>If you want to make your curls look even shorter, try pulling them apart. After diffusing your hair, use your fingers to gently pull the curls apart. This will make them look more voluminous and less long.</p><h3>Using the Right Products</h3><p>The right products can also help make your curly hair look shorter. Look for products that add volume and texture, like mousse or curl cream. Apply these products to your hair before diffusing or pulling your curls apart.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to making your curly hair look shorter:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a curl-friendly shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Apply a volumizing or texturizing product to your hair.</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair without disturbing your curls too much.</li><li>Use your fingers to gently pull your curls apart, making them look more voluminous.</li><li>If desired, get your hair layered by a professional hairstylist.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when making your curly hair look shorter:</p><ul><li>Be gentle with your curls.
