This method is best for those with wavy or curly hair. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when wet</li><li>Avoid using heat tools and chemical treatments that can damage your hair</li><li>Use hair products that enhance your natural curl pattern, such as curl creams or gels</li><li>Sleep with a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you've decided to go the natural hair care route, here's a step-by-step guide for getting natural permanent curls:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl-enhancing cream to damp hair</li><li>Divide your hair into sections and twist each section into a small bun</li><li>Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser on low heat</li><li>Once your hair is dry, gently unravel the buns and shake out your curls</li><li>Apply a lightweight oil or serum to add shine and reduce frizz</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Natural Permanent Curls</h2><p>Now that you have natural permanent curls, it's important to take care of them so they last.
