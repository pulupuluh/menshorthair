This will help create volume and hold your hairstyle in place.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a blow dryer, dry your hair while running your fingers through it to add lift and volume. Make sure to direct the air flow from your roots to your ends for the best results. </p><h3>Step 4: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, finish off your hairstyle with a light mist of hairspray. This will help hold your hair in place and maintain the volume throughout the day.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide to getting men's hair fluffy:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner.
