In this article, we’ll go over the steps you can take to address hair loss caused by COVID-19.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>COVID-19 is a viral illness that has affected millions of people around the world. While the primary symptoms of COVID-19 are respiratory in nature, the virus can also cause hair loss. This is because the virus can weaken the immune system, which can lead to hair loss. In addition, the stress of dealing with COVID-19 can also contribute to hair loss.</p><h2>How to Treat Hair Loss Due to COVID-19</h2><p>If you’re experiencing hair loss due to COVID-19, there are steps you can take to treat the condition. Here are some things you can do:</p><h3>1. Take Care of Your Scalp</h3><p>One of the best things you can do to treat hair loss is to take care of your scalp.
