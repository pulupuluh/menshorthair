This iconic decade was all about big, bold, and beautiful hair, and it's surprisingly easy to recreate this look at home. In this article, we'll take you through a step-by-step guide on how to do sixties hair, including tips, tricks, and a FAQ section to answer all your burning questions. So, grab your hairspray and let's get started!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Sixties hair was all about volume, texture, and drama. Think big bouffants, sleek bobs, and messy updos. This era was all about breaking away from the conservative styles of the past and embracing a more daring and playful look. Sixties hair was often styled with a lot of product, teasing, and backcombing to create the signature height and shape of the era.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Here's how to do sixties hair in six easy steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and towel-drying it until it's damp. Apply a volumizing mousse or spray to the roots and work it through your hair with your fingers. Blow-dry your hair upside down, using a round brush to add extra volume at the roots.</p><h3>Step 2: Tease your hair</h3><p>Take a section of hair at the crown of your head and tease it with a fine-toothed comb. Backcomb the hair towards your scalp in short, quick strokes. Repeat this process with several sections of hair at the crown of your head, working your way towards the front of your hairline.</p><h3>Step 3: Smooth it out</h3><p>Once you've teased your hair, gently smooth the top layer with a brush or comb. You want to create a smooth surface on top of the teased hair to make it easier to style.</p><h3>Step 4: Create your style</h3><p>There are many different sixties hairstyles to choose from, but one of the most iconic is the bouffant. To create a bouffant, gather the teased hair at the crown of your head and gently lift it upwards. Secure it with bobby pins or a clip. You can also create a sleek bob by using a straightening iron to smooth your hair and tucking the ends under.</p><h3>Step 5: Add the finishing touches</h3><p>Once you've created your style, add the finishing touches with hairspray. Spray your hair liberally, focusing on the roots and any flyaways. You can also add a hair accessory like a headband or a hair scarf to complete the look.</p><h3>Step 6: Enjoy your sixties hair!</h3><p>Now that you've mastered the art of sixties hair, it's time to rock your new look! Whether you're heading out to a party or just want to add a little retro flair to your everyday style, sixties hair is a fun and easy way to switch things up.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your sixties hair:</p><ul><li>Use a fine-toothed comb for teasing and backcombing</li><li>Don't be afraid to use a lot of hairspray</li><li>Experiment with different styles, from sleek bobs to messy updos</li><li>Accessorize with headbands, hair scarves, or vintage hair clips</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are a few frequently asked questions about sixties hair:</p><h3>Q: Can I do sixties hair on short hair?</h3><p>A: Absolutely! While some sixties styles work best on longer hair, there are plenty of ways to adapt the look for shorter hair. Try a sleek bob or a messy updo.</p><h3>Q: Do I need to use a lot of product?</h3><p>A: Yes, sixties hair was all about big volume and drama, so don't be afraid to use a lot of product. Volumizing mousse, hairspray, and dry shampoo are your friends!</p><h3>Q: Can I create sixties hair without teasing my hair?</h3><p>A: Teasing your hair is a key part of creating sixties hair, but if you're not comfortable with it, you can still create a retro look using other techniques like curling or straightening your hair.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Teasing and backcombing can be hard on your hair, so it's important to take care of your hair before and after styling. Use a nourishing shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and hydrated. You can also use a hair mask once a week to give your hair an extra boost of moisture.</p><p>When brushing your hair, use a gentle touch to avoid breaking or damaging your hair. And remember to always use heat protectant spray when using hot tools like curling irons or straightening irons.</p><p>By following these tips and taking care of your hair, you can enjoy sixties hair without damaging your locks!</p></article>
