Here are some of the most common causes:</p><h3>Androgenetic Alopecia</h3><p>Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is the most common cause of hair loss on the crown of the head. It's a genetic condition that affects both men and women and is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair on the crown of the head.</p><h3>Alopecia Areata</h3><p>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp. The hair loss can occur anywhere on the scalp, including the crown of the head. It's not clear what causes alopecia areata, but it's thought to be related to an overactive immune system.</p><h3>Traction Alopecia</h3><p>Traction alopecia is a type of hair loss that occurs when hair is pulled too tightly for an extended period of time. This can happen if you wear tight hairstyles like braids, cornrows, or ponytails. The pulling can cause damage to the hair follicles, which can lead to hair loss on the crown of the head.</p><h3>Telogen Effluvium</h3><p>Telogen effluvium is a condition that occurs when hair follicles enter the resting phase of the hair growth cycle prematurely. This can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress, illness, hormonal changes, and medication. Hair loss on the crown of the head is a common symptom of telogen effluvium.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Check for Hair Loss on the Crown of the Head</h2><p>If you're concerned about hair loss on the crown of your head, there are a few things you can do to check for it. Here's how:</p><h3>Use a Mirror</h3><p>Stand in front of a mirror and use another mirror to look at the crown of your head. Look for any areas where the hair looks thinner or where you can see your scalp.</p><h3>Take Photos</h3><p>Take photos of the crown of your head from different angles.

Avoid using hot water and harsh chemicals that can damage your hair.</p><h3>Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eat a healthy diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals.

Try a side part, a comb-over, or a textured haircut.</p><h3>Consider Hair Loss Treatments</h3><p>Consider hair loss treatments like minoxidil or finasteride.
