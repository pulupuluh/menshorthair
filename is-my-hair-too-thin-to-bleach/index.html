The easiest way to do this is to take a small section of hair and hold it up to the light. If you can see through the hair to your scalp, it's likely that your hair is too thin to handle the bleaching process.</p><p>Another way to assess hair thickness is to measure the circumference of a ponytail. If your ponytail is less than two inches in circumference, your hair may be too thin to bleach.</p><h2>Tips for Bleaching Thin Hair</h2><p>If you've determined that your hair is thin, but you still want to bleach it, there are a few things you can do to minimize damage:</p><ul><li>Use a lower volume developer. Opt for a 20 or 30 volume developer instead of a 40 volume developer, which is more harsh.</li><li>Avoid overlapping. Only bleach the sections of hair that need it, and be sure to avoid overlapping onto previously bleached hair.</li><li>Deep condition regularly. Use a deep conditioning treatment at least once a week to help restore moisture and prevent breakage.</li><li>Wait between bleachings. Give your hair time to recover between bleachings, and avoid bleaching more than once every four to six weeks.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Is it safe to bleach thin hair?</h3><p>Bleaching thin hair can be risky, as it can cause breakage and damage.
