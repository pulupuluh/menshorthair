Simply apply some heat protectant spray to your hair, then use the straightener to smooth down the offending strand.</p><h3>3. Use a Bobby Pin</h3><p>If all else fails, you can always use a bobby pin to hold your hair in place. Just be sure to use a pin that matches your hair color so it doesn't stand out.</p><h2>Step by Step: How to Fix One Side of Hair Sticking Out</h2><p>If you have a little more time and want a more permanent solution, here's a step-by-step guide to fixing one side of your hair sticking out:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup that might be contributing to the problem.</p><h3>Step 2: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Blow dry your hair straight using a round brush.
