Don't worry, we've got you covered! In this article, we will discuss some of the best updo hairstyles for curly hair weddings. Whether you're the bride, bridesmaid or just attending as a guest, these hairstyles will make you look stunning on your special day. So, let's get started!</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ol><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>Curly hair can be challenging to style, but that doesn't mean you have to compromise on your wedding day. Updo hairstyles are a great option for curly hair weddings as they keep the hair off the face and showcase the natural curls. There are several updo hairstyles that work well for curly hair, such as braids, buns, and twists. These hairstyles can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion, making them perfect for weddings.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The first step in creating an updo hairstyle for curly hair is to make sure your hair is properly moisturized. Curly hair tends to be dry, so using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner is essential. Once your hair is clean and conditioned, you can start styling it. Here are some steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Choose your hairstyle</h3><p>Decide on the type of updo hairstyle you want to create. You can choose from braids, buns, twists, or a combination of these. Look for inspiration online or in bridal magazines to find a style that you love.</p><h3>2. Prep your hair</h3><p>Apply a styling product to your hair to help define your curls and keep them in place. You can use a curl cream, gel, or mousse depending on your hair type. Comb your hair to distribute the product evenly.</p><h3>3. Section your hair</h3><p>Section your hair into smaller sections to make it easier to work with. Start at the back of your head and work your way forward. Use clips to hold each section in place.</p><h3>4. Create your updo</h3><p>Start creating your updo by twisting, braiding, or pinning each section of hair. Make sure to leave some curls loose to frame your face. Use bobby pins or hair ties to secure each section in place.</p><h3>5. Finish with hairspray</h3><p>Once your updo is complete, finish with a light hairspray to hold it in place. Don't use too much hairspray as it can weigh down your curls and make them look flat.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a simple braided updo for curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and condition your hair</h3><p>Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to clean and condition your curly hair. Make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly to remove all the product.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a styling product</h3><p>Apply a curl cream or mousse to your hair to help define your curls and keep them in place. Comb your hair to distribute the product evenly.</p><h3>Step 3: Section your hair</h3><p>Section your hair into smaller sections using clips. Start at the back of your head and work your way forward.</p><h3>Step 4: Braid your hair</h3><p>Start braiding each section of your hair. You can choose to do a regular braid or a French braid depending on your preference. Secure each braid with an elastic band.</p><h3>Step 5: Pin the braids</h3><p>Take each braid and wrap it around the base of your head, securing it with bobby pins. Make sure to tuck the ends of the braids neatly under the updo.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>Spray a light hairspray over your updo to hold it in place. Your braided updo is now complete!</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><ul><li>Don't wash your hair on the day of the wedding.
