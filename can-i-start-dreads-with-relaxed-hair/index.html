However, it may take longer to lock because relaxed hair is weaker and more fragile than natural hair.</p><h4>What method is best for starting dreads with relaxed hair?</h4><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question because it depends on your hair type and texture. However, the twist and rip method or the backcombing method are popular choices for starting dreadlocks with relaxed hair.</p><h4>How often should I wash my hair after starting dreadlocks?</h4><p>You should avoid washing your hair for the first few weeks after starting dreadlocks to allow them to settle and lock. After that, you can wash your hair once or twice a week with a residue-free shampoo to prevent buildup and keep your scalp clean.</p><h4>Can I color my hair after starting dreadlocks?</h4><p>Yes, you can color your hair after starting dreadlocks, but you should avoid bleach or harsh chemicals that can damage your hair.
