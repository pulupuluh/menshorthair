Bleach is a powerful chemical that is used to lighten hair, but it can also cause serious damage if not used correctly. If you've recently bleached your hair and are now dealing with dryness, breakage, and other damage, don't worry - there are steps you can take to restore your hair's health.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to-assess-damage">How to Assess Damage</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-repair-damaged-hair">How to Repair Damaged Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips-for-healthy-hair">Tips for Healthy Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-assess-damage">How to Assess Damage</h2><p>Before you begin any hair repair treatments, it's important to assess the extent of the damage. Look for signs of breakage, dryness, and split ends. You may also notice that your hair feels rough or brittle to the touch. If your hair is severely damaged, you may want to consider cutting it and starting fresh. However, if the damage is mild to moderate, you can work to repair it.</p><h2 id="how-to-repair-damaged-hair">How to Repair Damaged Hair</h2><p>There are several ways to repair damaged hair, and the right approach will depend on the severity of the damage. Here are a few options:</p><h3>1. Deep Conditioning Treatments</h3><p>Deep conditioning treatments can help to restore moisture to damaged hair. Look for products that contain ingredients like keratin, avocado oil, and shea butter. Apply the treatment to your hair and leave it on for at least 30 minutes (or as directed on the packaging) before rinsing it out.</p><h3>2. Protein Treatments</h3><p>Protein treatments can help to strengthen damaged hair. Look for products that contain hydrolyzed protein, which can penetrate the hair shaft and help to rebuild damaged strands. Apply the treatment to your hair and leave it on for the recommended amount of time before rinsing it out.</p><h3>3. Hair Oils</h3><p>Applying hair oils to your strands can help to lock in moisture and prevent breakage. Look for oils like argan oil, coconut oil, and jojoba oil. Apply a small amount to your hair and work it through your strands, focusing on the ends.</p><h2 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you're not sure where to start with repairing your damaged hair, follow this step-by-step guide:</p><h3>1. Assess the Damage</h3><p>Take a close look at your hair and determine the extent of the damage. This will help you to choose the right treatment approach.</p><h3>2.

Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools like straighteners and curling irons, as these can further damage your hair. If you must use heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray and keep the temperature as low as possible.</p><h2 id="tips-for-healthy-hair">Tips for Healthy Hair</h2><p>If you want to keep your hair healthy and prevent damage in the future, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p><h3>1.
