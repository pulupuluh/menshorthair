It is a popular hairstyle for dancers as it keeps hair in place and out of their faces while performing. In this article, we will go over how to slick back hair for dance in a step-by-step guide. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li> How to Prepare Your Hair </li><li> How to Apply Gel </li><li> How to Comb Your Hair </li><li> How to Secure Your Hair </li><li> Tips for Slicking Back Hair </li><li> FAQ </li><li> Hair Care </li></ul><h2> How to Prepare Your Hair </h2><p> Before you begin slicking back your hair, it is important to prepare it properly. This means washing and conditioning your hair to ensure it is clean and moisturized. Once you have washed your hair, dry it using a towel or a hair dryer on low heat. </p><p> Next, apply a small amount of hair oil or serum to your hair to give it some shine and prevent frizz. </p><h2> How to Apply Gel </h2><p> Gel is the key ingredient in achieving a slicked back look. Start by applying a small amount of gel to your fingertips and rub it between your palms. </p><p> Then, starting at the back of your head, apply the gel in a backwards motion, smoothing it down as you go. Be sure to apply enough gel to coat all of your hair evenly. </p><h2> How to Comb Your Hair </h2><p> Once you have applied the gel, it's time to comb your hair back. Using a fine-tooth comb, start at the front of your hairline and comb backwards, smoothing your hair down as you go. </p><p> Make sure to comb your hair evenly, so there are no bumps or lumps. If you have any flyaways or frizz, use a small amount of hairspray to keep them in place. </p><h2> How to Secure Your Hair </h2><p> To ensure your hair stays in place while you dance, you need to secure it properly. Start by using bobby pins or hair clips to pin back any loose strands or bangs. </p><p> Then, using a hair tie, create a low ponytail at the nape of your neck, making sure it is tight enough to hold your hair in place but not too tight that it causes discomfort. </p><h2> Tips for Slicking Back Hair </h2><p> Here are some tips to keep in mind when slicking back your hair for dance: </p><ul><li> Use a strong hold gel to ensure your hair stays in place </li><li> Don't use too much gel, as this can make your hair look greasy </li><li> Comb your hair evenly to avoid bumps or lumps </li><li> Use hairspray to keep flyaways and frizz in place </li><li> Secure your hair properly with bobby pins, hair clips, and a hair tie </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> Q: Can I slick back curly hair? </h3><p> A: Yes, you can slick back curly hair. However, you may need to use more product and a stronger hold gel to keep your curls in place. </p><h3> Q: How often should I wash my hair if I slick it back for dance? </h3><p> A: It is recommended that you wash your hair every 2-3 days if you slick it back for dance. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p> Slicking back your hair can cause damage if not done properly. To keep your hair healthy, it is important to use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and to avoid using too much product. </p><p> Additionally, it's a good idea to give your hair a break from slicking it back every once in a while to allow it to breathe and recover. </p><p> With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to achieve a perfect slicked back look for your next dance performance. </p></article>
