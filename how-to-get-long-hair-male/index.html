Be patient</h3><p>Growing long hair male takes time, so be patient. It can take up to two years to grow hair that is waist-length, so don’t get discouraged if you don’t see results right away. Stick to a healthy hair care routine, and your hair will grow.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you’re serious about getting long hair male, follow these steps:</p><h3>1.
