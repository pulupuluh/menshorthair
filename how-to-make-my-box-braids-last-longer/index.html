Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Choose the Right Size</h3><p>The size of your box braids can affect how long they last. Larger braids tend to unravel more quickly, while smaller braids can last longer. However, smaller braids can also take longer to install and can be more difficult to maintain.</p><h3>2. Use High-Quality Hair Extensions</h3><p>The quality of the hair extensions you use can also impact how long your box braids last.
