Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Choose the Right Size</h3><p>The size of your box braids can affect how long they last. Larger braids tend to unravel more quickly, while smaller braids can last longer. However, smaller braids can also take longer to install and can be more difficult to maintain.</p><h3>2. Use High-Quality Hair Extensions</h3><p>The quality of the hair extensions you use can also impact how long your box braids last. Look for extensions made from 100% human hair or high-quality synthetic hair. Cheaper hair extensions can tangle and frizz, causing your braids to look messy and unkempt.</p><h3>3.

Avoid playing with your braids or pulling them too tightly. You should also avoid wearing tight hairstyles, such as ponytails or buns, as these can put pressure on your braids and cause them to loosen.</p><h3>5.
