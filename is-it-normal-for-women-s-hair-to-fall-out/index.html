This is due to hormonal changes in the body.</p><h3>Q: Can medication cause hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, certain medications can cause hair loss. If you're experiencing hair loss, it's important to talk to your doctor about any medications you're taking.</p><h3>Q: Does hair loss only affect older women?</h3><p>A: No, hair loss can affect women of all ages.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Proper hair care can help prevent excessive hair loss. Here are some tips for caring for your hair:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use a Gentle Shampoo</h3><p>Using a gentle shampoo can help prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools, such as flat irons and curling irons, can damage your hair and lead to hair loss.</p><h3>Tip 3: Don't Overbrush Your Hair</h3><p>Overbrushing your hair can lead to hair loss.
