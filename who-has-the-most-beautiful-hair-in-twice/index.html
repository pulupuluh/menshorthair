She often sports a soft and wavy bob that frames her face perfectly. To achieve her look, try using a curling iron with a 1-inch barrel and curl your hair away from your face. Finish off by using a texturizing spray to give your hair some volume and texture.</p><h3 id="jeongyeon">Jeongyeon</h3><p>Jeongyeon is known for her short and edgy haircuts. She's rocked everything from a pixie cut to a bob, and she always looks amazing. If you want to emulate her style, try going for a shorter haircut and add some texture by using a wax or pomade. Jeongyeon often adds a pop of color to her hair as well, so don't be afraid to experiment with different shades.</p><h3 id="momo">Momo</h3><p>Momo's hair is always sleek and shiny, and she often wears it straight or in a high ponytail. To achieve her look, use a heat protectant spray before straightening your hair with a flat iron. Finish off with a shine spray or serum to give your hair a glossy finish.</p><h3 id="sana">Sana</h3><p>Sana is known for her long and flowing hair, and she often wears it in loose waves or a half-up, half-down style. To get her look, use a curling wand to create loose waves and pin back the top half of your hair. Sana also loves to add accessories to her hair, such as headbands or clips, so feel free to add some bling to your locks.</p><h3 id="jihyo">Jihyo</h3><p>Jihyo's hair is always on point, whether she's rocking a sleek and straight look or loose curls. To achieve her style, use a straightening iron to create a smooth finish or a curling iron to add some texture.

To achieve her look, use a curling wand to create loose waves or a straightening iron to create a sleek finish. Tzuyu often adds some highlights or ombre to her hair as well, so consider adding some color to your locks.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips</h2><p>Aside from styling, taking care of your hair is important to maintain its health and beauty.

If you have oily hair, you may need to wash it every day. If you have dry hair, you can wash it every other day or every few days.</li><li><strong>What should I do if I have damaged hair?</strong> Try using a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask to nourish and repair your hair. You can also try cutting back on heat styling and using a leave-in conditioner to protect your hair from further damage.</li><li><strong>Can I dye my hair?</strong> Yes, you can dye your hair, but make sure to use a hair dye that is safe and gentle for your hair type. It's also important to follow the instructions carefully and do a patch test before applying the dye to your entire head.</li></ul><p>Overall, all members of Twice have stunning hair, but it's up to you to find the style that suits you best.
