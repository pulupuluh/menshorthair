Here are some tips to get started: </p><h3> 1. Use a Leave-In Conditioner </h3><p> Curly hair tends to be dry, so using a leave-in conditioner can help keep it moisturized and healthy.

Apply a Styling Product </h3><p> There are many different styling products you can use for curly hair, including creams, gels, and mousses. Experiment with different products to find one that works for your hair type and desired style. Apply the product to damp hair and work it through with your fingers. </p><h3> 3. Use a Diffuser </h3><p> A diffuser is a tool that attaches to your blow dryer and helps distribute the heat evenly throughout your hair. It can help enhance your curls and reduce frizz.
