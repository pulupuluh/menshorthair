Look no further than short spiky haircuts. This style has been popular for decades, and in 2021, it's still on-trend. In this blog post, we will discuss everything you need to know about short spiky haircuts 2021, including how to style them, tips for maintaining them, and more.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short spiky haircuts are a hairstyle that features short hair styled into spikes. This style is typically achieved by using hair gel or wax to create a defined, spiky look. The length of the hair can vary, but it's generally cut short, with the spikes being the focal point of the style. Short spiky haircuts are often associated with a punk or rock 'n' roll aesthetic, but they can be worn by anyone looking for a bold and edgy look.</p><h2>How to Style Short Spiky Haircuts</h2><p>Styling short spiky haircuts is relatively easy, but it does require some product and a bit of practice. Here are the steps to styling short spiky haircuts:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Begin by washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Once your hair is clean, towel dry it to remove excess water. You can also blow dry your hair if you want to speed up the drying process.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply product</h3><p>Next, apply a small amount of hair gel or wax to your fingertips. Rub your hands together to distribute the product evenly. Then, apply the product to your hair, focusing on the sections you want to spike up.</p><h3>Step 3: Spike your hair</h3><p>Using your fingers, spike up the sections of your hair that you want to create the spiky look. You can use a comb or brush to help shape your spikes, but your fingers will give you the most control.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>Once you've spiked your hair, finish with a light mist of hairspray. This will help hold your spikes in place throughout the day.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Short Spiky Haircuts</h2><p>While short spiky haircuts are relatively low-maintenance, they do require some upkeep to keep them looking their best. Here are some tips for maintaining short spiky haircuts:</p><h3>Tip 1: Trim your hair regularly</h3><p>Short haircuts tend to grow out quickly, so it's essential to trim your hair regularly to maintain your spiky style. You can do this yourself with a pair of scissors or visit a hairstylist for a more professional trim.</p><h3>Tip 2: Use high-quality hair products</h3><p>The key to achieving the perfect spiky look is using high-quality hair products. Look for products that are specifically designed for short hair and provide a strong hold.</p><h3>Tip 3: Protect your hair from heat damage</h3><p>If you use heat tools like blow dryers or straighteners, it's essential to protect your hair from heat damage. Use a heat protectant spray before styling to minimize damage.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can short spiky haircuts be worn by anyone?</h3><p>A: Yes, short spiky haircuts can be worn by anyone looking for a bold and edgy look. However, it's essential to consider your face shape and hair texture when choosing this hairstyle.</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my hair if I have a short spiky haircut?</h3><p>A: It's recommended to wash your hair every other day if you have a short spiky haircut. Washing your hair too frequently can strip it of its natural oils and lead to dryness and damage.</p><h3>Q: Can I style my short spiky haircut without using product?</h3><p>A: While it's possible to style your short spiky haircut without using product, it's unlikely to achieve the same spiky look. Hair gel or wax is necessary to create the defined spikes that are characteristic of this style.</p><h2>Hair Care for Short Spiky Haircuts</h2><p>Short spiky haircuts require some extra care to keep them looking their best. Here are some hair care tips for short spiky haircuts:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use a clarifying shampoo</h3><p>Because short spiky haircuts require the use of hair products, it's essential to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup. This will help keep your hair healthy and prevent damage.</p><h3>Tip 2: Deep condition your hair</h3><p>Deep conditioning your hair once a week can help keep it soft and healthy. Look for a deep conditioning treatment that is specifically designed for short hair.</p><h3>Tip 3: Avoid over-styling</h3><p>While short spiky haircuts can be styled in many different ways, it's essential to avoid over-styling your hair. Too much heat or product can lead to dryness, damage, and breakage.</p><p>Short spiky haircuts are a trendy and edgy look that is perfect for anyone looking to make a bold statement with their hairstyle. With the right products and care, you can achieve the perfect spiky look that will turn heads everywhere you go.</p></article>
