It is a powerful medication that works by reducing the amount of oil produced by the skin's sebaceous glands, which can help prevent clogged pores and acne breakouts.</p><h3 id="does-accutane-cause-hair-thinning">Does Accutane Cause Hair Thinning?</h3><p>Yes, Accutane is known to cause hair thinning in some people. Hair thinning is listed as one of the potential side effects of the medication, and it is thought to be caused by the drug's ability to reduce oil production in the scalp. This reduction in oil can lead to dryness, irritation, and inflammation of the scalp, which can cause hair to become thin and brittle.</p><h3 id="will-hair-thinning-stop-after-accutane">Will Hair Thinning Stop After Accutane?</h3><p>It is possible for hair thinning to stop after Accutane treatment is discontinued. However, it may take some time for your hair to return to its normal thickness and for any hair loss to be reversed. The amount of time it takes for this to happen can vary from person to person, but it is generally thought to take several months to a year.</p><p>If you are experiencing hair thinning after taking Accutane, it is important to talk to your doctor.
