A rectangular face shape is characterized by a strong jawline, a broad forehead, and a straight hairline. If you have a rectangular face shape, you might find it challenging to choose a haircut that complements your features. However, with the right styling and haircut, you can enhance your facial features and look stunning. Here’s everything you need to know about the best haircut for rectangular face shape.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A rectangular face shape is often referred to as an oblong face shape.
