A rectangular face shape is characterized by a strong jawline, a broad forehead, and a straight hairline. If you have a rectangular face shape, you might find it challenging to choose a haircut that complements your features. However, with the right styling and haircut, you can enhance your facial features and look stunning. Hereâs everything you need to know about the best haircut for rectangular face shape.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A rectangular face shape is often referred to as an oblong face shape.
