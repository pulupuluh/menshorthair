You may also need a spray bottle with water to dampen your hair.</p><h3>2. Determine the length</h3><p>Decide how short you want the sides to be and how long you want the top to be. You can use a clipper guard to achieve a uniform length on the sides or use scissors for a more textured look.</p><h3>3.

Start with a larger guard and work your way down to a shorter one to create a fade or taper.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the back</h3><p>Use the same clipper and guard to cut the hair on the back of your head.

This will give it a more natural and relaxed look.</p><h3>Step 9: Style your hair</h3><p>Apply a styling product, such as pomade or wax, to your hair and style it as you like.
