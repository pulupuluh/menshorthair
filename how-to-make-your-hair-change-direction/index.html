If you want a side part, then you will need to part your hair on the side. If you want your hair to go in a different direction, then you will need to decide which way you want to comb your hair.</p><p>Once you have decided which direction you want your hair to go in, you will need to use a comb or brush to comb your hair in that direction. You may also want to use a styling product such as a gel or mousse to help your hair hold its shape.</p><p>If you have long hair, you may also want to consider using a hair clip or hair tie to keep your hair in place while you style it. This will make it easier to comb your hair in the direction you want it to go in.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>The first step to changing the direction of your hair is to start with clean and dry hair.
