One of the most popular hairstyles for boys is the short back and sides. This style is easy to maintain and looks great on all ages. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do short back and sides on your child.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The short back and sides is a classic hairstyle that involves cutting hair short on the back and sides while leaving the hair on top longer. This style can be adapted to suit different hair types and face shapes.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Follow these steps to achieve the short back and sides look:</p><h3>Step 1: Prepare the Hair</h3><p>Wash and towel-dry your child’s hair before starting the haircut. Comb the hair to remove any tangles and make sure it’s free from any styling products.</p><h3>Step 2: Section the Hair</h3><p>Using a comb, create a parting on your child’s hair from the top of one ear to the top of the other ear. Clip the top section of hair out of the way and comb the hair on the back and sides downwards.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose the Right Clipper Guard</h3><p>Select the clipper guard size that you want to use. For a short back and sides, start with a larger guard size such as a #4 or #5, then gradually work your way down to a smaller guard size for a more tapered look.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Cutting</h3><p>Starting at the nape of the neck, use the clipper to cut the hair in an upward motion towards the parting. Move the clipper in a smooth and steady motion to create an even cut. Continue cutting the hair on the sides and back, working your way up towards the parting.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Hair</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting the hair with the larger clipper guard, switch to a smaller guard size and blend the hair between the longer hair on top and the shorter hair on the sides and back. Use a comb and scissors to tidy up any uneven patches.</p><h3>Step 6: Cut the Top</h3><p>Unclip the top section of hair and comb it straight up. Use scissors to trim the hair to the desired length. Make sure the top section blends in with the shorter hair on the back and sides.</p><h3>Step 7: Finish with Styling Products</h3><p>Apply a small amount of hair wax or gel to the hair on top to add texture and hold. Style the hair as desired.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to make the process easier:</p><ul><li>Make sure your child is comfortable and sits still during the haircut.</li><li>Use a towel or cape to protect your child’s clothes from hair clippings.</li><li>If you’re not confident with using clippers, start with scissors and work your way up to clippers.</li><li>Take breaks if your child needs them. It’s better to take your time and do a good job than rush through the haircut.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>1. How often should I trim my child’s hair?</h3><p>It depends on how fast your child’s hair grows. On average, a haircut every 6-8 weeks is recommended to maintain the short back and sides look.</p><h3>2. Can I do short back and sides on curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can. However, it’s important to find a hairdresser who is experienced with cutting curly hair to ensure the best results.</p><h3>3. What are the benefits of short back and sides?</h3><p>The short back and sides is a low-maintenance hairstyle that looks great on all ages. It’s also versatile and can be adapted to different hair types and face shapes.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your child’s hair healthy, it’s important to wash and condition it regularly. Use a mild shampoo and conditioner that’s suitable for their hair type. Avoid using hot styling tools and harsh chemicals as these can damage the hair. Trim the ends regularly to prevent split ends and breakage.</p><p>Now that you know how to do short back and sides on a child, it’s time to give your child a fresh, new look. With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a professional-looking haircut at home.</p></article>
