This means that there are more hairs growing out of each follicle, making the hair look fuller and thicker. While this can be great for some people, it can also make it difficult to style and manage.

Use Heat Tools</h3><p>If you want to make your hair thinner without cutting it, you can use heat tools to temporarily straighten your hair. This will make your hair look flatter and less voluminous.
