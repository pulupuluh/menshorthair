Hair curls when the cuticles on the hair strands are lifted, causing the hair to expand and take on a curly shape. Therefore, to avoid curly hair, we need to focus on keeping the cuticles flat and smooth.</p><p>The following are some ways to avoid curly hair:</p><h3>1. Use a Quality Flat Iron or Straightening Brush</h3><p>Invest in a good flat iron or straightening brush that can effectively straighten your hair without causing damage. Look for one that has adjustable heat settings and ceramic plates that can distribute heat evenly. Using the right tool can make a big difference in preventing curls.</p><h3>2. Blow Dry Your Hair in Sections</h3><p>When blow drying your hair, divide it into sections and use a round brush to pull each section straight while blow drying. This will help to keep the cuticles flat and smooth, while also giving your hair a sleek look.</p><h3>3. Apply a Heat Protectant</h3><p>Before using any heat styling tools, make sure to apply a heat protectant to your hair. This will help to prevent damage and keep your hair healthy. Look for a heat protectant that also has smoothing properties to help keep your hair straight.</p><h3>4. Avoid Humidity</h3><p>Humidity can cause your hair to curl or frizz, so try to avoid it as much as possible.
