In 1 Corinthians 11:15 (KJV), it says, "But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering." This verse is saying that a woman's hair is given to her as a natural covering and is a symbol of her femininity.</p><p>It is also important to note that a woman's hair is often associated with her identity. In the Old Testament, when Samson's hair was cut, he lost his strength and power (Judges 16:17-22). In the New Testament, a woman who had been forgiven much washed Jesus' feet with her hair, which was seen as a sign of her repentance (Luke 7:36-50).</p><h2 id="should-women-cover-their-hair-in-the-church">Should Women Cover Their Hair in the Church?</h2><p>1 Corinthians 11:5-6 (KJV) says, "But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."</p><p>This passage is saying that women should cover their heads when praying or prophesying in church as a sign of respect and submission.
