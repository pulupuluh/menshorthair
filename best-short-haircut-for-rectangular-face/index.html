You want a style that will compliment your features and make your face appear more balanced. In this article, we’ll go over the best short haircuts for rectangular faces, as well as tips for maintaining healthy hair. <h2>Description</h2> A rectangular face shape is characterized by a longer face length and a narrower width. The jawline is typically square, and the forehead and cheekbones are of similar width. To balance out the face shape, it’s best to choose a short haircut that adds width to the sides of the face. <h2>How to Choose the Best Short Haircut for Rectangular Face</h2> When choosing a short haircut for a rectangular face, it’s important to consider the following factors: <h3>Face Shape</h3> As mentioned, rectangular face shapes have a longer face length and narrower width. To balance this out, choose a haircut that adds width to the sides of the face. <h3>Hair Texture</h3> Consider your hair texture when choosing a short haircut. If you have thick hair, you may want to opt for a layered cut to add movement and texture. If you have fine hair, a blunt bob may be more suitable. <h3>Lifestyle</h3> Choose a short haircut that fits your lifestyle. If you’re someone who prefers low-maintenance styles, a pixie cut may be a great option. If you’re looking for something more versatile, a layered bob may be the way to go. <h2>Best Short Haircuts for Rectangular Face</h2> Now that you know what to consider when choosing a short haircut for a rectangular face, let’s take a look at some of the best styles: <h3>Pixie Cut</h3> The pixie cut is a timeless classic that works well for rectangular face shapes. It adds width to the sides of the face and draws attention to the eyes. This low-maintenance style is perfect for those who want to save time on styling. <h3>Layered Bob</h3> The layered bob is a versatile style that can be customized to suit any face shape. For rectangular faces, ask your stylist to add layers to the sides of the hair to create the illusion of width. This style is perfect for those who want a low-maintenance cut that can be dressed up or down. <h3>Blunt Bob</h3> The blunt bob is a chic and sophisticated style that works well for rectangular faces. This cut adds width to the sides of the face and frames the jawline, creating a balanced look. This style is perfect for those who want a polished and professional look. <h2>Step by Step: Getting the Perfect Short Haircut for Rectangular Face</h2> Now that you know which short haircuts work best for rectangular faces, it’s time to book your appointment with a trusted stylist. Follow these steps to ensure you get the perfect cut: <h3>Step 1: Find Inspiration</h3> Before heading to the salon, find inspiration for your new haircut.
