In 1 Peter 3:3-4, the Bible says, "Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight."</p><p>This passage reminds us that our true beauty comes from our character and not from our physical appearance. While it is okay to take care of our appearance, we should not place too much emphasis on it. Instead, we should focus on cultivating a gentle and quiet spirit, which is pleasing to God.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you do decide to dye your hair, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure that the dye you use is safe and does not contain harmful chemicals. Second, consider your motives for dyeing your hair.
