Here's what you'll need:</p><ul><li>Sharp scissors</li><li>A comb</li><li>Clips or hair ties</li><li>A mirror (ideally a full-length one)</li></ul><p>Once you have your tools ready, you can start by washing and drying your hair. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start cutting, as wet hair can appear longer than it actually is.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you have all the tools you need, here's a step-by-step guide to cutting and layering your own curly hair:</p><ol><li>Start by combing your hair straight down, so that it falls evenly around your head.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from the front of your head, and hold it between your fingers at the length you want to cut it. Make sure your fingers are parallel to the floor.</li><li>Cut the hair just below your fingers, using sharp scissors. Be careful not to cut too much off at once â it's better to take small snips and check your progress as you go.</li><li>Repeat this process with small sections of hair around your head, moving from the front of your head to the back. Make sure each section is the same length as the one before it.</li><li>Now it's time to add layers. Take a small section of hair from the top of your head, and hold it straight up in the air.</li><li>Cut the hair at a slight angle, so that the top layer is slightly shorter than the bottom layer. This will create a layered effect.</li><li>Repeat this process with small sections of hair around your head, always cutting at a slight angle to create layers.</li><li>Once you've finished cutting and layering your hair, comb it out and check for any unevenness or missed spots.

If you do decide to cut your hair when it's wet, make sure you're aware of this and adjust your cutting accordingly.</p><h3>How often should I cut my curly hair?</h3><p>This depends on your hair type and how quickly it grows. In general, we recommend getting a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</p><h3>What if I mess up my hair?</h3><p>Don't panic! If you make a mistake, you can always visit a professional stylist to fix it. It's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your hair.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Curly Hair</h2><p>Now that you've cut and layered your curly hair, it's important to take care of it properly. Here are some tips for keeping your curly hair healthy and beautiful:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid using heat tools on your hair, as this can cause damage and frizz.</li><li>Invest in a good leave-in conditioner to help keep your curls hydrated and defined.</li><li>Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to help prevent frizz and breakage.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause breakage and frizz. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and techniques, you can cut and layer your own curly hair with confidence.
