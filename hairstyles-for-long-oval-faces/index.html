In this guide, we've rounded up the best hairstyles for long oval faces, along with some tips and tricks to help you achieve the perfect look.</p><h2>What is a Long Oval Face Shape?</h2><p>A long oval face shape is characterized by a longer shape than the typical oval face shape. The forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all similar in width, and the face has a slight taper towards the chin. If you're not sure if you have a long oval face shape, measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. If they're all similar, and your face is longer than it is wide, you have a long oval face shape.</p><h2>How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>If you're not sure what your face shape is, there are a few ways to determine it. One way is to take a selfie and draw an outline of your face shape using a photo editing tool. Another way is to measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline, as we mentioned earlier. You can also use a mirror to trace the outline of your face with a dry erase marker and see what shape it resembles the most.</p><h2>Best Hairstyles for Long Oval Faces</h2><h3>1. Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers are a great option for long oval faces because they add volume and dimension to the hair, which can balance out the length of the face. They're also versatile and work well with both straight and curly hair.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can help shorten the face and draw attention to the eyes. They work well with both long and short hair and can be styled straight or wavy.</p><h3>3. Bob Haircut</h3><p>A bob haircut that falls just below the chin can help balance out the length of a long oval face. It's a classic and timeless look that works well with straight and wavy hair.</p><h3>4. Beachy Waves</h3><p>Beachy waves are a great option for long oval faces because they add volume and texture to the hair, which can help balance out the length of the face. They're also low-maintenance and easy to style.</p><h3>5. Pixie Cut</h3><p>If you're feeling daring, a pixie cut can be a great option for long oval faces. It can help shorten the face and draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones. It's also low-maintenance and easy to style.</p><h2>How to Style Your Hair for a Long Oval Face</h2><p>When styling your hair for a long oval face, it's important to focus on adding volume and texture to the hair.

Also, avoid hairstyles that add too much volume to the top of the head, as they can make the face appear even longer.</p><h3>Can I wear a middle part with a long oval face?</h3><p>Yes, you can wear a middle part with a long oval face, but it's best to add some volume to the hair to balance out the length of the face.</p><h3>Should I get bangs if I have a long oval face?</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are a great option for long oval faces because they can help shorten the face and draw attention to the eyes.
