One of the most common problems that blondes face is getting red or orange tones in their hair. This can happen due to various reasons such as using the wrong hair dye or exposure to sunlight. If you are struggling with this issue, don't worry! In this article, we will provide you with some tips and tricks on how to get rid of red orange tones in blonde hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Red or orange tones in blonde hair can happen due to a variety of reasons. It could be because of using the wrong hair dye or not leaving the dye on for long enough. Exposure to sunlight or using too much heat on your hair can also cause these tones. Whatever the reason, getting rid of them can be a tricky process. But with the right tips and tricks, you can get your blonde hair looking perfect once again.</p><h2>How to Get Rid of Red Orange Tones in Blonde Hair</h2><p>There are several ways to get rid of red orange tones in blonde hair. Here are some of the most effective techniques:</p><h3>1. Use a Purple Shampoo</h3><p>Purple shampoo is a great way to neutralize the red and orange tones in your hair. It contains purple pigments that counteract the warm tones in your hair and bring out cooler tones. Use it once or twice a week to get the best results.</p><h3>2. Try a Toner</h3><p>If your hair is still looking brassy after using a purple shampoo, try using a toner. A toner is a semi-permanent hair color that helps to neutralize unwanted tones. It can be used on its own or mixed with a developer to create a more customized shade.</p><h3>3. Use a Color Corrector</h3><p>If your hair is very brassy, you may need to use a color corrector. A color corrector is a product that helps to remove unwanted tones from your hair. It is usually applied before shampooing and can be left on for up to 20 minutes.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know the different ways to get rid of red orange tones in blonde hair, here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Product</h3><p>Choose a product that is specifically designed to remove red and orange tones from blonde hair. You can choose from a purple shampoo, toner, or color corrector, depending on the severity of the problem.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any dirt or buildup.

Choose one product that suits your needs and follow the instructions carefully.</p><h3>Q: How often should I use a purple shampoo?</h3><p>A: Use a purple shampoo once or twice a week, depending on how often you wash your hair.
