For example, if you have a round face, you may want to go for a shorter style with layers to add volume.</li><li>Think about your hair texture: If you have naturally curly hair, you may want to avoid a style that requires a lot of straightening or blow-drying.</li><li>Look at pictures for inspiration: Browse online or in magazines to find pictures of short hairstyles that you like. Bring these pictures to your stylist so they can get a better idea of what you're looking for.</li><li>Consider your lifestyle: If you're always on the go and don't have a lot of time to style your hair, you may want to opt for a low-maintenance style.</li></ul><h3>Short Hairstyles for Over 60 with Grey Hair</h3><p>Here are a few short hairstyles that are particularly flattering for women over 60 with grey hair:</p><ul><li>Pixie cut: This short, layered style is easy to maintain and can be styled in many different ways.</li><li>Bob: A classic bob can be updated with layers or a side-swept fringe.</li><li>Shag: This layered style is perfect for adding volume and texture to fine hair.</li><li>Cropped cut: This ultra-short style is chic and modern.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions for Styling</h2><p>Once you've chosen your new short hairstyle, it's time to learn how to style it.
