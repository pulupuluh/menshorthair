In fact, the average person sheds between 50 and 100 hairs per day. Shedding is a natural part of the hair growth cycle, where the old hair falls out to make way for new hair to grow. Hair loss, on the other hand, is when hair falls out and doesn't grow back. Hair loss can be temporary or permanent, depending on the cause.</p><p>Shedding is a temporary condition that can be caused by stress, pregnancy, illness, medication, or seasonal changes. Hair shedding usually occurs evenly throughout the scalp and doesn't result in noticeable thinning or bald patches. Hair loss, on the other hand, can be caused by genetics, hormonal changes, autoimmune disorders, or scalp infections. Hair loss can occur in patches or all over the scalp, leading to noticeable thinning or baldness.</p><h3 id="causes">Common Causes of Hair Shedding and Hair Loss</h3><p>There are different reasons why hair sheds or falls out.
