However, those with long hair tend to experience it more frequently. Dandruff is characterized by the shedding of skin cells from the scalp, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including dry skin, oily skin, and fungal infections.</p><p>When your hair is long, it's more difficult to reach your scalp to clean it properly.

Wash your hair regularly</h3><p>Regular hair washing can help to prevent the buildup of oils and dead skin cells on your scalp.
