However, it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal factors. Female pattern baldness is often associated with an increase in the male hormone, testosterone, which can cause hair follicles to shrink and produce thinner hair. <h2> How to Combat Female Pattern Baldness </h2> There are several ways to combat female pattern baldness, including: - Lifestyle changes - Medications - Hair restoration surgery - Hairpieces and wigs <h3> Lifestyle Changes </h3> Making certain lifestyle changes can help combat female pattern baldness.
