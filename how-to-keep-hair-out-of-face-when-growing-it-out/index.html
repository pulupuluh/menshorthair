It can be frustrating to constantly have to push your hair back, and it can also cause breakouts and irritation on your skin. In this article, we will be discussing the best ways to keep your hair out of your face while you grow it out.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Keep Hair Out of Face When Growing it Out</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step: Keeping Hair Out of Face</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Keeping Hair Out of Face</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Growing Out Hair</a></li></ol><h2 id="how-to">How to Keep Hair Out of Face When Growing it Out</h2><p>There are several techniques you can use to keep your hair out of your face while you grow it out. The best method for you will depend on your hair type and personal preference. Here are some of the most effective ways to keep your hair out of your face:</p><h3>Pinning</h3><p>Pinning your hair back is one of the simplest ways to keep it out of your face. You can use bobby pins, hair clips, or barrettes to hold your hair back. Start by sectioning off the hair in the front and sides of your face and pinning it back. You can also twist sections of hair and pin them back to create a more stylish look.</p><h3>Braiding</h3><p>Braiding your hair is another effective way to keep it out of your face. French braids, Dutch braids, and fishtail braids are all popular options. To create a French braid, start by sectioning off a small piece of hair at the top of your head. Divide it into three sections and begin braiding, gradually adding in more hair as you go. Secure the braid with an elastic band at the end.</p><h3>Ponytail</h3><p>A simple ponytail can also keep your hair out of your face. You can wear it high or low, depending on your preference. To create a sleek ponytail, use a brush to smooth your hair back and secure it with an elastic band. You can also add a hair tie or scrunchie for a pop of color.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step: Keeping Hair Out of Face</h2><p>Here is a step by step guide on how to keep your hair out of your face:</p><ol><li>Section off the hair in the front and sides of your face.</li><li>Pin it back with bobby pins, hair clips, or barrettes.</li><li>Create a French braid or other type of braid.</li><li>Secure the braid with an elastic band.</li><li>Create a high or low ponytail.</li><li>Smooth your hair back with a brush.</li><li>Secure the ponytail with an elastic band.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Keeping Hair Out of Face</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for keeping your hair out of your face:</p><ul><li>Use a headband or scarf to keep hair off your forehead.</li><li>Apply hairspray or gel to keep hair in place.</li><li>Try a half-up, half-down hairstyle.</li><li>Use a hair clip to create a side-swept look.</li><li>Avoid touching your hair throughout the day.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: What type of braid is best for keeping hair out of your face?</h3><p>A: French braids are a popular choice for keeping hair out of your face.
