Bleaching can be damaging to your hair, causing it to become dry and brittle, which can lead to breakage and hair loss. In this article, we will discuss how to get hair to stop falling out after bleaching.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Get Hair to Stop Falling Out After Bleaching</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Get Hair to Stop Falling Out After Bleaching</h2><p>There are several things you can do to help stop hair loss after bleaching:</p><h3>1. Use a Protein Treatment</h3><p>Protein treatments can help to strengthen your hair and prevent breakage. Look for products that contain keratin or hydrolyzed silk. These ingredients can help to repair damaged hair and prevent further damage.</p><h3>2. Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>Deep conditioning treatments can help to moisturize your hair and prevent it from becoming dry and brittle. Look for products that contain natural oils, such as coconut oil or argan oil. These oils can help to nourish your hair and prevent breakage.</p><h3>3. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can be damaging to your hair, especially if it is already weak from bleaching. Try to avoid using heat styling tools, such as flat irons or curling irons, as much as possible. If you must use heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray to help protect your hair.</p><h3>4. Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Tight hairstyles, such as braids or ponytails, can put stress on your hair and cause breakage. Try to avoid wearing tight hairstyles, or at least give your hair a break from tight hairstyles every few days.</p><h3>5. Be Gentle When Brushing or Combing Your Hair</h3><p>When your hair is weak from bleaching, it is more prone to breakage. Be gentle when brushing or combing your hair, and use a wide-tooth comb or a brush specifically designed for detangling.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here are some step-by-step instructions to help you get hair to stop falling out after bleaching:</p><h3>1.
