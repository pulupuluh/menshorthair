However, there are general principles in the Bible that can guide our decision-making about beauty and appearance.</p><p>First, we are reminded in 1 Peter 3:3-4 that true beauty comes from a gentle and quiet spirit, not from outward adornment. This means that our focus should be on cultivating inner beauty rather than solely relying on external enhancements.</p><p>Additionally, in 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, we are reminded that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and that we should honor God with our bodies. This means that we should take care of our bodies, but not to the point of idolizing our appearance or putting too much emphasis on physical beauty.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to get hair extensions is a personal one that should be made with prayer and discernment. As long as it aligns with our desire to honor God with our bodies and doesn't become an obsession, it's acceptable.</p><h3 id="howto">How to Get Hair Extensions</h3><p>If you've decided to get hair extensions, there are a few things to consider before getting started.</p><p>First, you'll need to decide on the type of hair extensions you want.
