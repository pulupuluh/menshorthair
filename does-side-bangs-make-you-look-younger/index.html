If so, you may be wondering if side bangs can help you achieve this goal. Side bangs have long been considered a youthful and trendy hairstyle, but do they really make you look younger? In this article, we'll explore the answer to this question and provide tips, how-to, and hair care advice for those considering side bangs.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#does_side_bangs_make_you_look_younger">Does Side Bangs Make You Look Younger?</a></li><li><a href="#how_to_get_side_bangs">How to Get Side Bangs</a></li><li><a href="#tips_for_side_bangs">Tips for Side Bangs</a></li><li><a href="#faq_about_side_bangs">FAQ About Side Bangs</a></li><li><a href="#hair_care_for_side_bangs">Hair Care for Side Bangs</a></li></ul><h2 id="does_side_bangs_make_you_look_younger">Does Side Bangs Make You Look Younger?</h2><p>The short answer is yes, side bangs can make you look younger. How? Side bangs can draw attention away from fine lines and wrinkles on the forehead, which can help to create a more youthful appearance. Additionally, side bangs can help to soften a square-shaped face or a high forehead, both of which can make a person look older. </p><p>However, it's important to note that not everyone will look younger with side bangs. If you have a round face, for example, side bangs may not be the best choice as they can make the face appear even rounder. It's important to consider your face shape and features before deciding if side bangs are right for you.</p><h2 id="how_to_get_side_bangs">How to Get Side Bangs</h2><p>If you've decided that side bangs are right for you, the next step is to figure out how to get them. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p><ol><li>Start by sectioning off the hair in front of your ears. This will be the hair you cut into bangs.</li><li>Comb the hair forward and hold it between your fingers where you want the bangs to start. </li><li>Cut the hair straight across, making sure to not cut too much at once. You can always cut more later.</li><li>Continue cutting the hair, moving down the section and cutting at a slight angle towards the back of the head. </li><li>Once you've cut all the hair, check to make sure the bangs are even. If not, trim as needed.</li><li>Style the bangs as desired, using a blow dryer and round brush to add volume or a straightener to create a sleek look.</li></ol><p>It's important to note that if you're not confident in cutting your own bangs, it's best to go to a professional stylist. They can help you achieve the look you want while avoiding any mistakes that could be costly to fix.</p><h2 id="tips_for_side_bangs">Tips for Side Bangs</h2><p>Now that you have your side bangs, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Don't wash your bangs too often. Over-washing can cause them to become greasy and limp. Instead, use dry shampoo to refresh them between washes.</li><li>If you have curly or wavy hair, use a diffuser when blow-drying your bangs to avoid frizz.</li><li>Consider using a heat protectant spray when using hot tools on your bangs to prevent damage.</li><li>Trim your bangs every 4-6 weeks to keep them looking fresh and prevent them from getting too long.</li><li>If you're not happy with your bangs, don't be afraid to try a different style or length. Bangs can always grow out, so don't be afraid to experiment.</li></ul><h2 id="faq_about_side_bangs">FAQ About Side Bangs</h2><h3>Q: Will side bangs work for all hair types?</h3><p>A: While side bangs can work for many hair types, they may not be the best choice for those with very curly or coarse hair. Bangs can be difficult to control and style in these hair types, so it's important to consult with a stylist before making the cut.</p><h3>Q: Can I still wear my hair up with side bangs?</h3><p>A: Yes! Side bangs can actually add a fun, flirty touch to many updo styles. Consider leaving out a few pieces of hair around your face to create a more relaxed, bohemian look.</p><h2 id="hair_care_for_side_bangs">Hair Care for Side Bangs</h2><p>Finally, it's important to take care of your side bangs to keep them looking their best. Here are some hair care tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Avoid using heavy products on your bangs as they can weigh them down and make them look greasy. Opt for lightweight, volumizing products instead.</li><li>When blow-drying your bangs, use a round brush to add volume and create a smooth, sleek look.</li><li>Consider using a silk pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage while you sleep.</li><li>If you're experiencing breakouts along your hairline, use a gentle cleanser to keep the area clean and avoid touching your bangs throughout the day.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, side bangs can be a great way to add a youthful touch to your look. However, it's important to consider your face shape and hair type before making the cut. With the right care and styling, your side bangs can help you look and feel your best.</p></article>
