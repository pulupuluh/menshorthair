Continue cutting small sections of hair until you have cut the entire back section.</li><li>Move on to the side sections. Comb the hair straight down and cut it to the same length as the back section. Make sure to cut the hair at an angle, so it blends well with the back section.</li><li>Finally, move on to the top section. Comb the hair straight up and cut it to your desired length.
