Using clippers can be a great way to achieve a neat and tidy haircut without having to visit a barber. In this article, we will provide you with a step by step guide on how to trim guys hair with clippers.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Trimming your hair with clippers can be a relatively easy process, especially if you have the right tools and know the right techniques. Below are the steps you should follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the right clippers</h3><p>The first step in trimming your hair is to choose the right clippers. You want to choose clippers that are specifically designed for hair cutting. These clippers usually come with a range of attachments that can be adjusted to different hair lengths.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the right length</h3><p>Once you have chosen your clippers, you need to choose the right length. This will depend on the length of your hair and the style you want to achieve. It is best to start with a longer length and work your way down. This will give you more control and prevent you from cutting your hair too short.</p><h3>Step 3: Section your hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, you need to section it. This will help you to get an even cut and prevent you from missing any areas. Use hair clips to section your hair into manageable sections.</p><h3>Step 4: Start cutting</h3><p>Now it's time to start cutting. Begin at the back of your head and work your way to the front. Use the longest attachment first and work your way down to shorter attachments. Make sure to keep the clippers level with your head and move them in an upward motion.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the sides and back</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting the top of your hair, it's time to blend the sides and back. Use a smaller attachment and work your way up from the bottom. Use a sweeping motion to blend the hair and make sure to check the mirror to ensure that the sides and back are even.</p><h3>Step 6: Clean up the neckline and around the ears</h3><p>Finally, it's time to clean up the neckline and around the ears. Use the clippers without an attachment to clean up the hair around the neckline. Use a comb to pull the hair away from the ears and use the clippers to trim any hair that is sticking out.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Trimming your hair with clippers can be a great way to achieve a professional-looking haircut at home.
