Be sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair, from roots to tips.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a blow dryer, dry your hair while lifting at the roots with your fingers or a round brush. This will help to create maximum volume and bounce.</p><h2>Tips for Achieving Maximum Volume</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve maximum volume when using volumizing hair mousse:</p><ul><li>Blow-dry your hair upside down for added lift at the roots</li><li>Use a round brush to add volume and shape to your hair</li><li>Apply the mousse to your roots for extra lift</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to enhance natural curls and waves</li></ul><h2>Best Volumizing Hair Mousses of 2021</h2><p>Here are some of the best volumizing hair mousses available on the market today:</p><h3>1.
