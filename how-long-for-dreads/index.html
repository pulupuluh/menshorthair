The answer is not straightforward, as it depends on several factors, including your hair type, length, and maintenance routine. In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know about how long for dreads and what you can expect during the process.</p><h2>How To Get Dreads</h2><p>Before we get into how long it takes to get dreads, let's first discuss how to get them. There are several methods for creating dreads, including backcombing, twisting and rip and twist. The method you choose will depend on your hair type and personal preference. It's important to note that getting dreads is a long-term commitment, as they can take several months to form and require ongoing maintenance.</p><h3>Backcombing</h3><p>Backcombing involves teasing the hair backwards towards the scalp to create knots. This method is ideal for those with straight or wavy hair and can take anywhere from 6-12 hours to complete, depending on your hair length and thickness.</p><h3>Twisting</h3><p>Twisting involves sectioning the hair and twisting it together to create knots. This method is ideal for those with curly or kinky hair and can take anywhere from 3-6 hours to complete, depending on your hair length and thickness.</p><h3>Rip and Twist</h3><p>Rip and twist involves separating the hair into sections and pulling it apart to create knots. This method is ideal for those with any hair type and can take anywhere from 3-6 hours to complete, depending on your hair length and thickness.</p><h2>Step By Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know the different methods for getting dreads, let's go over a step-by-step guide for the backcombing method:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup.</li><li>Section your hair into small sections using clips.</li><li>Backcomb each section of hair, starting at the ends and working your way up towards the scalp.</li><li>Twist each section of hair in the same direction.</li><li>Palm roll each section of hair to smooth out any bumps and encourage the knots to form.</li><li>Repeat steps 3-5 on all sections of hair.</li><li>Once all sections of hair are backcombed, twisted and palm rolled, apply a locking gel or wax to encourage the knots to form.</li><li>Cover your hair with a scarf or durag to help the knots set overnight.</li><li>In the morning, remove the scarf or durag and gently separate any sections that have fused together.</li><li>Repeat steps 7-9 daily until your dreads have formed.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Dreads</h2><p>Once your dreads have formed, it's important to maintain them to keep them healthy and looking their best. Here are some tips for maintaining your dreads:</p><ul><li>Wash your dreads regularly with a residue-free shampoo.</li><li>Avoid using heavy oils or products that can cause buildup.</li><li>Retwist your dreads every 4-6 weeks to keep them looking neat.</li><li>Avoid using a hair dryer, as the heat can cause damage to your dreads.</li><li>Cover your dreads with a scarf or durag at night to prevent them from unraveling.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How long does it take for dreads to lock up?</h3><p>The amount of time it takes for dreads to lock up varies depending on your hair type and maintenance routine. Generally, it can take anywhere from 3-6 months for your dreads to fully form and lock up.</p><h3>Can I wash my dreads?</h3><p>Yes, it's important to wash your dreads regularly to keep them clean and healthy. However, it's important to use a residue-free shampoo and avoid using heavy oils or products that can cause buildup.</p><h3>Can I get dreads if I have relaxed hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can get dreads if you have relaxed hair. However, the process may take longer and require more maintenance, as relaxed hair is more prone to breakage and may not hold knots as well as natural hair.</p><h2>Hair Care for Dreads</h2><p>When it comes to hair care for dreads, it's important to use products that won't cause buildup or damage your hair. Here are some hair care tips for dreads:</p><ul><li>Use a residue-free shampoo to wash your dreads.</li><li>Avoid using heavy oils or products that can cause buildup.</li><li>Retwist your dreads every 4-6 weeks to keep them looking neat.</li><li>Avoid using a hair dryer, as the heat can cause damage to your dreads.</li><li>Cover your dreads with a scarf or durag at night to prevent them from unraveling.</li></ul><p>Overall, the process of getting dreads can take several months and requires ongoing maintenance. However, if you're willing to commit to the process, the end result can be a unique and stylish hairstyle that you'll love.</p></article>
