This edgy hairstyle is a perfect blend of business in the front and party in the back. If you're looking to try out the new mullet hairstyle, this step-by-step guide will show you how to achieve the look.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The new mullet hairstyle is a modern take on the classic 80s mullet. It features short hair on the sides and longer hair on top and in the back. The length of the hair can vary, but typically the top and back hair is at least 2-3 inches longer than the sides.</p><h2>How to Cut the New Mullet Hairstyle</h2><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have the right tools. You'll need a pair of hair cutting scissors, clippers, a comb, and a mirror. Follow these steps to cut the new mullet hairstyle:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before you start cutting. This will make it easier to see and cut evenly. Use a comb to part your hair down the middle.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the sides</h3><p>Using your clippers, start cutting the sides of your hair. Use a 1 or 2 guard to keep the sides short. Start at the bottom and work your way up, using the comb to guide the clippers. Make sure both sides are even.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the top</h3><p>Now it's time to cut the top of your hair. Use your scissors to cut the hair in the middle of your head to the desired length. This can vary depending on your personal preference, but typically the hair on top is 2-3 inches long. Use the comb to guide the scissors and make sure the hair is even.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the back</h3><p>The back of the hair is what gives the mullet its iconic look. Use your scissors to cut the hair in the back to the desired length. This can be longer than the hair on top, but again, it depends on your personal preference. Use the comb to guide the scissors and make sure the hair is even.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the hair</h3><p>Now that you've cut the sides, top, and back, it's time to blend the hair. Use your clippers and scissors to blend the hair together, making sure there are no harsh lines. Use the comb to guide the clippers and scissors and to check for any unevenness.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish the look</h3><p>Once you've cut and blended your hair, it's time to style it. Use a hair product like gel or wax to style the hair on top and in the back. You can also use a blow dryer to add volume to the hair. Don't forget to style the hair in the front to complete the look.</p><h2>Tips for Cutting the New Mullet Hairstyle</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect new mullet hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Start with longer hair if you're not sure how short to go.</li><li>Take your time and be patient. Cutting hair can be tricky, especially if you're doing it for the first time.</li><li>Use a mirror to check the back of your head as you cut.</li><li>Ask a friend or family member to help you if you're not comfortable cutting your own hair.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can the new mullet hairstyle be worn by both men and women?</h3><p>A: Yes, the new mullet hairstyle can be worn by both men and women. It's all about personal preference and how you style the hair.</p><h3>Q: Do I need to have straight hair to pull off the new mullet hairstyle?</h3><p>A: No, the new mullet hairstyle can be worn with any hair texture. Just make sure to style the hair in a way that works with your natural texture.</p><h3>Q: How often do I need to trim my hair to maintain the new mullet hairstyle?</h3><p>A: It depends on how fast your hair grows and how often you want to maintain the look. Typically, a trim every 4-6 weeks should be enough to keep the hair looking fresh.</p><h2>Hair Care for the New Mullet Hairstyle</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep your new mullet hairstyle looking its best:</p><ul><li>Use a shampoo and conditioner that's suited for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can damage it.</li><li>Use a hair mask or deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down the hair and make it look greasy.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to cut the new mullet hairstyle, it's time to give it a try. Remember to be patient and take your time, and don't be afraid to experiment with different lengths and styles. Before you know it, you'll be rocking the perfect mullet.</p></article>
