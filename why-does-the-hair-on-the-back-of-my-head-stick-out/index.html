If so, you're not alone. Many people struggle with this issue, but the good news is that there are steps you can take to address it.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The hair at the back of your head is known as the occipital area. This area is prone to sticking out due to a few factors, such as hair texture, cowlicks, and how you style your hair. The hair in this area also tends to be coarser and more difficult to manage than other parts of your head, contributing to the problem.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're wondering how to fix this issue, there are a few things you can try:</p><h3>1. Blow-dry your hair</h3><p>Using a round brush and a blow dryer, you can smooth out the hair at the back of your head. Make sure to point the nozzle of the blow dryer downwards to prevent frizz and flyaways.</p><h3>2. Use a flat iron</h3><p>If your hair is particularly unruly, you can use a flat iron to straighten it out. However, be careful not to use too much heat, as this can damage your hair.</p><h3>3. Try a different haircut</h3><p>If you have a lot of cowlicks or a particularly stubborn hair texture, you may benefit from a different haircut. Talk to your stylist about options that will help tame the hair at the back of your head.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to blow-drying your hair to smooth out the hair at the back of your head:</p><h3>Step 1:</h3><p>Wash your hair and towel dry it until it's damp.</p><h3>Step 2:</h3><p>Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair to prevent heat damage.</p><h3>Step 3:</h3><p>Section your hair and use a round brush to dry each section.
