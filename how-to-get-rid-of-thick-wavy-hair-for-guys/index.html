Look for products that are designed for thick, wavy hair, such as curl creams and gels. These products can help to define your waves and keep them under control.</p><h3>Straighten Your Hair</h3><p>If you want to get rid of your waves altogether, you can get a chemical treatment to straighten your hair. This process involves applying a chemical solution to your hair that breaks down the bonds that give your hair its natural texture. The process can take several hours, but the results can last for several months.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Process</h2><p>If you're planning to cut your hair short, here's a step-by-step process to follow:</p><ol><li>Start by washing your hair and towel-drying it.</li><li>Use a comb to part your hair where you want it.</li><li>Use clippers to cut your hair to the desired length.</li><li>Blend the sides and back of your hair with a shorter clipper guard.</li><li>Use scissors to texture the top of your hair.</li><li>Style your hair using a product that works with your hair type.</li></ol><p>If you're planning to use hair products to tame your waves, here's a step-by-step process to follow:</p><ol><li>Start by washing your hair and towel-drying it.</li><li>Apply a curl cream or gel to your hair.</li><li>Use a comb or your fingers to work the product through your hair.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair using a diffuser attachment.</li><li>Style your hair using a product that works with your hair type.</li></ol><p>If you're planning to get a chemical treatment to straighten your hair, you'll need to visit a salon.
