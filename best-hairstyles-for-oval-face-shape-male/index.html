It's characterized by a forehead that's slightly wider than the chin, and the cheekbones are the widest part of the face. Men with oval face shapes can rock almost any hairstyle, from short to long. The key is to choose a hairstyle that enhances your best features and balances out your proportions.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Best Hairstyle for Oval Face Shape Male</h2><p>The first step in choosing the best hairstyle for oval face shape male is to determine your face shape.

If the measurements are roughly the same, then you have an oval face shape.</p><p>Once you've determined your face shape, it's time to consider your hair type and texture. This will help you narrow down your hairstyle options. For example, if you have thick, wavy hair, you might want to consider a side-swept undercut or a messy fringe. On the other hand, if you have fine hair, a short, textured crop might work best.</p><p>Another factor to consider is your personal style and lifestyle.
