But fear not! You can still curl your hair and create a variety of gorgeous looks. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps of how to curl short hair with shaved sides, from choosing the right tools to finishing off your look with the perfect products.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short hair with shaved sides is a bold and edgy look that requires minimal maintenance. However, it can be challenging to style, especially if you're used to having longer hair. One of the most popular ways to switch up your look is by curling your hair. But how do you curl short hair with shaved sides without damaging your hair or creating an awkward imbalance? We've got you covered.</p><h2>How to Curl Short Hair with Shaved Sides</h2><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start curling, you need to make sure your hair is clean and dry. Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, and let it air dry or use a blow dryer on a cool setting. If you have naturally curly hair, you may not need to use any additional products. However, if your hair is straight or fine, you may want to use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose Your Tools</h3><p>The right curling tool can make all the difference when it comes to achieving the perfect curls. For short hair with shaved sides, we recommend using a curling wand or a flat iron. A curling wand will give you more defined, bouncy curls, while a flat iron will create more natural-looking waves.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into small sections using clips or hair ties. Start at the back of your head and work your way forward. Make sure to leave out the shaved sides so that you don't accidentally burn or damage your skin.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Curling</h3><p>Take a small section of hair and wrap it around the curling wand or flat iron. Hold for a few seconds, then release. Repeat this process on each section of hair until you've curled your entire head.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Products</h3><p>Once you've curled your hair, you can finish off your look with some styling products. Use a hairspray or a texturizing spray to add volume and hold to your curls. If you want a more natural look, you can use a sea salt spray to create beachy waves.</p><h2>Tips for Curling Short Hair with Shaved Sides</h2><p>Curling short hair with shaved sides can be tricky, so here are some tips to help you get the best results:</p><ul><li>Use a smaller curling wand or flat iron to create tighter curls</li><li>Leave out the shaved sides to avoid burning or damaging your skin</li><li>Don't hold the curling tool on your hair for too long to avoid heat damage</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage to your hair</li><li>Don't brush or comb your curls too much, as this can cause frizz</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I curl short hair with shaved sides?</h3><p>Yes!

Also, don't hold the curling tool on your hair for too long, and use a lower heat setting if possible.</p><h2>Hair Care for Short Hair with Shaved Sides</h2><p>Short hair with shaved sides requires minimal maintenance, but it's still important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking great. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Avoid using heat on your hair too often</li><li>Use a hair mask or deep conditioner once a week to keep your hair moisturized</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends</li><li>Avoid using too many styling products, as this can weigh down your hair</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to curl short hair with shaved sides, you can experiment with different styles and create a look that's uniquely you. Remember to take care of your hair and use the right tools and products to keep it healthy and looking great.</p></article>
