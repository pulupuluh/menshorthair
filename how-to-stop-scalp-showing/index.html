For example, you can part your hair on the opposite side to create more volume, or use a hairpiece or extensions to add length and fullness.</p><h3>3. Avoid harsh chemicals.</h3><p>Chemical treatments like relaxers and perms can damage hair and make scalp showing more noticeable. If possible, try to avoid these treatments or opt for gentler alternatives like keratin treatments or natural hair straightening methods.</p><h3>4. Eat a healthy diet.</h3><p>A nutritious diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote healthy hair growth and reduce scalp showing. Focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.</p><h3>5.
