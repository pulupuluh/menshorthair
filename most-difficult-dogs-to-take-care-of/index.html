Use a brush that's appropriate for their hair type, and be gentle to avoid hurting their skin. If your dog has mats or tangles in their coat, use a detangling spray or a mat breaker tool to gently remove them. It's also important to bathe your dog regularly to keep their coat clean and healthy. Use a shampoo that's formulated for their specific hair type, and rinse thoroughly to avoid leaving any residue on their skin.</p><p>In conclusion, choosing a difficult dog to take care of can be a rewarding experience, but it requires a lot of patience, time, and effort.
