Spray the heat protectant evenly on your hair, making sure to cover every strand.</p><h3>3. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small sections before using a flat iron. This will help you work on one section at a time, ensuring that every strand is straightened evenly. Use clips to secure each section in place.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide to Flat Ironing Thin Damaged Hair</h2><p>Follow these steps to achieve a smooth and sleek finish on your thin damaged hair:</p><h3>1.
