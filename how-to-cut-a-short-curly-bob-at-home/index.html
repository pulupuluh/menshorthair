Dull scissors can cause split ends and damage to your hair.</p><h2 id="prep">Prepping Your Hair</h2><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair as usual. Once you've towel-dried it, comb through any tangles and part your hair where you prefer. Then, divide your hair into four sections: two in the front and two in the back.</p><p>Clip or tie back the sections you're not currently working on to keep them out of the way. Spray the section you're starting with with water to dampen it slightly. This will make it easier to cut and give you more control.</p><h2 id="cutting">Cutting Your Hair</h2><p>Begin with the front sections of your hair. Take a small section of hair and comb it straight down. Hold the strand between your fingers at the length you want to cut it. Then, using your scissors, cut the hair in a straight line.</p><p>Repeat this process, working your way through each section. When you get to the back sections, you may need to use a mirror to see what you're doing.</p><p>Remember to cut little by little – you can always cut more, but you can't put hair back once it's been cut. It's better to err on the side of caution and take your time.</p><h2 id="finishing">Finishing Touches</h2><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, take a look in the mirror to make sure everything looks even.
