Here are some tips for cutting thick hair short:</p><ul><li>Choose a style that works with your hair's natural texture. If you have curly hair, for example, choose a style that embraces your curls rather than trying to straighten them out.</li><li>Ask your stylist to thin out your hair to reduce bulk. This will make it easier to style and can prevent your hair from looking too heavy or boxy.</li><li>Consider a layered cut to add movement and dimension to your hair.</li><li>Don't be afraid to try bangs if you like them, but keep them on the longer side to avoid adding too much bulk to your hair.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Short Thick Hair</h2><p>Now that you have the right cut, it's time to style your short thick hair.
