If you're still not sure, you can take your dog to the vet for a check-up.</p><h3>Common Signs of Hair Loss in Dogs:</h3><ul><li>Bald spots</li><li>Thinning fur</li><li>Patches of bare skin</li><li>Scaly, inflamed skin</li><li>Excessive shedding</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Hair Loss in Dogs</h2><p>If you've determined that your dog is losing hair, it's important to figure out why.
