When hair is dry, it lacks moisture, which can make it prone to breakage and damage. Frizz occurs when the hair cuticle becomes raised, allowing moisture to enter the hair shaft and causing it to swell. Wavy hair can exacerbate the problem of dryness and frizz, as the natural texture of wavy hair tends to be more porous and prone to frizz.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Get Rid of Dry Frizzy Wavy Hair</h2><p>If you're struggling with dry frizzy wavy hair, there are several things you can do to get rid of it:</p><h3>1. Use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Look for shampoos and conditioners that are specifically designed to hydrate and moisturize dry hair. These products should contain ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, and coconut oil, which can help to nourish and hydrate your hair.</p><h3>2. Use a deep conditioning treatment</h3><p>Once a week, use a deep conditioning treatment to give your hair an extra dose of moisture. Apply the treatment to your hair, focusing on the ends, and leave it in for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it out.</p><h3>3. Don't over-wash your hair</h3><p>Washing your hair too frequently can strip it of its natural oils, which can make it even more prone to dryness and frizz. Try to wash your hair no more than every other day, or even less frequently if your hair is particularly dry.</p><h3>4. Use a leave-in conditioner</h3><p>After washing your hair, apply a leave-in conditioner to help keep your hair moisturized throughout the day. Look for a product that is specifically designed for wavy or curly hair, as these products will be more effective at taming frizz.</p><h3>5. Use a hair oil</h3><p>Applying a hair oil to your hair can help to smooth down the hair cuticle and prevent frizz. Look for a lightweight hair oil that won't weigh your hair down, and apply it sparingly to the ends of your hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to getting rid of dry frizzy wavy hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair with a hydrating shampoo and conditioner.</h3><p>Choose a shampoo and conditioner that are specifically designed for dry hair.
