Frizz occurs when the hair cuticle is raised, allowing moisture to enter the hair shaft and create a puffy, frizzy appearance. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including humidity, heat damage, and using the wrong hair products.</p><p>To control frizzy curly short hair, you need to focus on smoothing the hair cuticle and keeping moisture out. This can be achieved through a combination of styling techniques and hair care practices.</p><h3>Choose the Right Hair Products</h3><p>The right hair products can make all the difference when it comes to controlling frizzy curly short hair. Look for products that are specifically designed for curly hair, as these will contain ingredients that help to smooth the hair cuticle and reduce frizz.
