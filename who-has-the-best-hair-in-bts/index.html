However, if we had to choose, we'd say that Jungkook has the best hair in BTS. He's experimented with various hairstyles, from long hair to short hair, and he always manages to pull it off. His hair is always styled perfectly, and he's not afraid to try something new.</p><p>However, other members also have excellent hairstyles. For example, V's purple hair during the "Dynamite" era was a fan favorite, while Jimin's pink hair during the "Blood Sweat &amp; Tears" era was iconic. Suga's mint hair during the "Spring Day" era also deserves an honorable mention.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Achieve BTS Hairstyles</h2><p>If you want to achieve a BTS hairstyle, the first step is to find a style that suits you. You can look through photos of the members or watch their music videos to get inspiration.
