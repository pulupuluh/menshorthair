This will help you create tighter curls that will hold their shape for longer.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>The material of the curling iron will also affect the outcome of your curls. Ceramic and tourmaline curling irons are best for short hair as they produce gentle heat that won't damage your hair. Titanium curling irons are also a good option for short hair as they heat up quickly and evenly.</p><h3>Temperature</h3><p>Short hair doesn't need as much heat as long hair to curl.
