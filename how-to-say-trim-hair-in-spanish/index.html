It's often used when you want to trim just a little bit of hair, or when you want to give your hair a neater look.</li><li>"Podar el cabello": This phrase is commonly used in Mexico and Central America. It literally means "prune hair" and is often used when you want to get rid of split ends or damaged hair.</li><li>"Cortar las puntas": If you only want to trim the ends of your hair, you can use this phrase. It means "cut the tips" and is a common request in Spanish-speaking salons.</li></ul><p>Remember to use the appropriate verb form depending on who is doing the trimming.
