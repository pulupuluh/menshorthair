While there are many factors that contribute to hair loss, one of the most important is a lack of biotin. Biotin, also known as vitamin H, is a B vitamin that plays a vital role in the growth and maintenance of healthy hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Many people are unaware of the benefits of biotin for hair growth. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the production of healthy hair. It helps to strengthen the hair shaft, which reduces breakage and promotes the growth of new hair.

Biotin supplements are available in capsule or tablet form and can be found at most health food stores.
