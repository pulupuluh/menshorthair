This can happen due to various reasons, such as cancer, endometriosis, or other medical conditions. The surgery usually involves the removal of both ovaries, which results in the immediate onset of menopause symptoms.</p><h3 id="section2">Does Surgical Menopause Cause Hair Loss?</h3><p>Yes, surgical menopause can cause hair loss. The sudden drop in estrogen levels after the removal of the ovaries can lead to a condition called telogen effluvium, which causes hair follicles to enter a resting phase and fall out. Women who go through surgical menopause may also experience a decrease in hair density, making their hair look thinner and less full.</p><p>However, not all women who undergo surgical menopause experience hair loss. The severity and duration of hair loss can vary from person to person, depending on several factors such as age, genetics, overall health, and stress levels.</p><h3 id="section3">How to Manage Hair Loss During Surgical Menopause</h3><p>Managing hair loss during surgical menopause can be challenging, but it is not impossible.
