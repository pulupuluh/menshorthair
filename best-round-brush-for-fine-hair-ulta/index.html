Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><h3>Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>Before using a round brush, make sure your hair is clean and dry. Wet hair is more prone to breakage, and using a round brush on wet hair can cause damage and frizz.</p><h3>Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>Before using any heat styling tools, it's important to apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair. This will help prevent damage and keep your hair looking healthy.</p><h3>Section Your Hair</h3><p>To make styling easier, section your hair into smaller sections using clips. This will allow you to focus on one section at a time, ensuring each section gets the attention it needs.</p><h3>Use the Right Technique</h3><p>When using a round brush, start at the roots and work your way down to the ends, rolling the brush away from your face as you go.
