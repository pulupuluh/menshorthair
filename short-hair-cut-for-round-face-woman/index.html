Best 13 Short haircuts for round faces inspirations you can</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>If you have a round face, finding the right short hair cut can be a challenge. But fear not! With the right style, you can enhance your natural beauty and feel confident in your new look. In this article, we will discuss how to choose the perfect short hair cut for round face women. We will cover everything from how to determine your face shape to tips for maintaining your new hairstyle. So, let's get started!</p><h2>How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>The first step in choosing the perfect short hair cut for your round face is to determine your face shape. Here's how:</p><ol><li>Stand in front of a mirror with your hair pulled back.</li><li>Use a washable marker or lipstick to trace the outline of your face on the mirror.</li><li>Step back and look at the shape you have drawn. Is it oval, round, square, heart-shaped, or diamond-shaped?</li></ol><p>If your face is round, you will have full cheeks and a rounded chin. Your face will be widest at the cheeks and ears and narrower at the forehead and jawline.</p><h2>Choosing the Perfect Short Hair Cut</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, it's time to choose the perfect short hair cut. Here are some tips to help you:</p><h3>1. Avoid Styles That Add Bulk</h3><p>If you have a round face, you want to avoid styles that add bulk to the sides of your head. This means avoiding styles like the bob, which can make your face look wider. Instead, choose a shorter style that is tapered at the sides to create the illusion of a slimmer face.</p><h3>2. Go for Length on Top</h3><p>Short hair cuts that have length on top can help elongate your face and make it appear less round. A pixie cut with long bangs or a short bob with layered bangs can be great options.</p><h3>3. Consider a Side Part</h3><p>A side part can help create the illusion of a longer face. Try parting your hair on the side and sweeping it across your forehead to create a more angular look.</p><h3>4. Embrace Texture</h3><p>Adding texture to your short hair cut can help create the illusion of a slimmer face. Consider adding layers or choppy ends to your style to create movement and dimension.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Your Short Hair Cut</h2><p>Now that you have chosen the perfect short hair cut, it's time to learn how to style it. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body to your hair.</p><h3>2. Apply a Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product, such as mousse or gel, to your hair to help create volume and hold.</p><h3>3. Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Blow dry your hair using a round brush to create volume at the roots. Focus on lifting the hair at the crown of your head to create height.</p><h3>4. Style Your Hair</h3><p>Use a styling product, such as wax or pomade, to add texture and definition to your hair. Style your hair using your fingers to create the desired shape and volume.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Short Hair Cut</h2><p>Now that you have the perfect short hair cut, it's important to maintain it to keep it looking great. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Short hair cuts require regular trims to keep them looking neat and tidy.

Look for products that add volume, texture, and hold.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair</h3><p>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before using hot tools like curling irons or straighteners.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What short hair cut is best for a round face?</h3><p>A short hair cut that is tapered at the sides and has length on top is best for a round face. Consider a pixie cut with long bangs or a short bob with layered bangs.</p><h3>How often should I get a trim?</h3><p>Short hair cuts require regular trims to keep them looking neat and tidy.
