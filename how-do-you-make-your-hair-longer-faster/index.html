Try to avoid using heat styling tools as much as possible or use them on a low heat setting.</p><h3>3.

Use your fingertips to gently massage your scalp for a few minutes each day.</p><h3>4. Use Hair Growth Products</h3><p>There are many hair growth products on the market that claim to help your hair grow faster. Look for products that contain ingredients like biotin, keratin, and vitamins to promote hair growth.</p><h3>5.
