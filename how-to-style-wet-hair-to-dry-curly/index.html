Styling wet hair to dry curly is easier than you might think. In this blog post, we will show you how to achieve beautiful, bouncy curls without using any heat. Follow these simple steps, and you'll be rocking your natural curls in no time!</p><h2>How to</h2><p>The first step in styling wet hair to dry curly is to wash your hair with a good quality shampoo and conditioner. Make sure to use products that are specifically designed for curly hair. After washing, gently pat your hair dry with a towel. Avoid rubbing your hair, as this can cause frizz.</p><p>Next, apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair. This will help to keep your curls hydrated and prevent frizz. Apply the conditioner evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends.</p><p>Once you have applied the leave-in conditioner, it's time to apply a curl-defining product. This can be a cream, gel, or mousse, depending on your hair type. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, making sure to distribute it evenly from root to tip.</p><p>Next, divide your hair into sections. Start at the bottom and work your way up. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle each section, making sure to separate your curls. This will help to define your curls and prevent them from clumping together.</p><p>Once you have detangled each section, scrunch your hair upwards towards your scalp. This will encourage your curls to form and create volume. Repeat this process for each section until your entire head is scrunched.</p><p>Finally, let your hair air dry. Avoid using a hairdryer, as this can cause frizz and damage your curls. Once your hair is completely dry, scrunch it again to break up any crunchiness from the product. You can also use a little bit of oil or serum to add shine and reduce frizz.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a good quality shampoo and conditioner.
