The bangs should be swept to the side to create a diagonal line that breaks up the length of the face.</p><h3>Bob with Volume</h3><p>A bob with volume is perfect for rectangular face shapes as it creates the illusion of a wider face. The bob should be chin-length and layered to add volume and movement to the hair.</p><h3>Wavy Lob</h3><p>A wavy lob is a great option for rectangular face shapes as it adds volume and movement to the hair.
