Don't worry, you're not alone. Many people experience hair fall during the hot season due to various reasons such as sweat, dust, pollution, and exposure to the sun. In this article, we'll give you tips and tricks on how to control hair fall in summer in Hindi. So, let's get started!</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#howto">How to Control Hair Fall in Summer</a></li><li><a href="#stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips to Prevent Hair Fall</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care Tips for Summer</a></li></ul><h2 id="howto">How to Control Hair Fall in Summer</h2><p>There are various ways to control hair fall during summer. Here are some of them:</p><h3>1. Keep Your Scalp Clean</h3><p>During summer, our scalp tends to get oily and sweaty, which can lead to hair fall. Therefore, it's essential to keep your scalp clean by washing it regularly with a mild shampoo. A clean scalp will prevent the accumulation of dust and dirt, which can clog hair follicles and lead to hair fall.</p><h3>2. Oil Your Hair</h3><p>Oiling your hair regularly can help prevent hair fall during summer. Oil nourishes your hair and scalp, keeping them healthy and hydrated. You can use coconut oil, almond oil, or any other oil that suits your hair type. Massage the oil onto your scalp and hair, leave it on for an hour or two, and then wash it off with a mild shampoo.</p><h3>3. Use a Conditioner</h3><p>Using a conditioner after shampooing your hair can help prevent hair fall. Conditioners hydrate your hair and make it more manageable, preventing tangles and breakage. Use a conditioner that suits your hair type and apply it only to the ends of your hair.</p><h3>4. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>During summer, it's best to avoid heat styling tools such as straighteners, curling irons, and hair dryers. Heat styling can damage your hair and lead to hair fall. Instead, let your hair air dry naturally, or use a cool setting on your hair dryer.</p><h3>5. Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>The sun's UV rays can damage your hair and make it dry and brittle, leading to hair fall. Therefore, it's essential to protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or a scarf. You can also use a hair serum or spray that contains SPF to protect your hair from the sun.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to control hair fall in summer:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair regularly with a mild shampoo.</h3><h3>Step 2: Oil your hair once or twice a week.</h3><h3>Step 3: Use a conditioner after shampooing your hair.</h3><h3>Step 4: Avoid heat styling tools.</h3><h3>Step 5: Protect your hair from the sun.</h3><h2 id="tips">Tips to Prevent Hair Fall</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to prevent hair fall during summer:</p><h3>1.
