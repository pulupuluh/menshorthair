This causes the hair to grow in a spiral shape. When the hair is wet, the weight of the water can cause the hair to stretch and lose its spiral shape. This is why curly hair often looks straight when it's wet.</p><p>Another factor that can contribute to curly hair going straight when wet is the hair's porosity. High porosity hair absorbs water quickly, which can cause the hair to lose its curl pattern.
