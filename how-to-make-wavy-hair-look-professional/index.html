A layered haircut is ideal for wavy hair as it adds structure and definition to your waves. If you have long hair, consider adding face-framing layers to balance out your face shape. If you have short hair, opt for a layered bob or a pixie cut to give your hair some movement.</p><p>Once you have the right cut, it’s time to style your hair. Here are some tips on how to make wavy hair look professional:</p><h3>1. Blow-dry your hair</h3><p>Blow-drying your hair is essential to achieving a sleek, professional look. Start by applying a heat protectant spray to your hair to prevent damage. Then, use a round brush to blow-dry your hair in sections, starting from the roots and working your way down to the ends. Use the cool setting on your hairdryer to set your style.</p><h3>2. Use a flat iron</h3><p>If your waves are too unruly, use a flat iron to tame them. Start by sectioning your hair and using a heat protectant spray. Then, use your flat iron to straighten your hair in sections. Don’t forget to use the cool setting to set your style.</p><h3>3. Add some texture</h3><p>Wavy hair already has texture, but you can enhance it by using a texturizing spray. This will give your hair more definition and make it look more polished.</p><h3>4. Finish with a hairspray</h3><p>Finally, finish off your look with a hairspray to keep your hair in place.
