The litter box then scoops the waste into a container, which can be easily disposed of. These litter boxes are great for busy cat owners who don't have time to scoop the litter box every day.</p><h3>Top-Entry Litter Boxes</h3><p>Top-entry litter boxes have a covered top that your cat enters through. The litter is contained in the box, so there's no need to worry about litter getting kicked out onto your floor. These litter boxes are great for reducing litter tracking and mess.</p><h3>Disposable Litter Boxes</h3><p>Disposable litter boxes are made from biodegradable materials and can be easily disposed of after use. These litter boxes are great for people who don't have the space to store a traditional litter box.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose a Low Maintenance Cat Litter Box</h2><p>When choosing a low maintenance cat litter box, there are a few things to consider:</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Make sure the litter box is big enough for your cat to comfortably move around in.
