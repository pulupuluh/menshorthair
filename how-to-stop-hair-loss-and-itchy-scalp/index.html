Common causes of hair loss and itchy scalp include stress, hormonal changes, genetics, poor nutrition, and certain medical conditions. Once you know the cause, you can take steps to prevent and treat the problem.</p><h3>1. Manage Stress</h3><p>Stress is a common cause of hair loss and itchy scalp. To manage stress, you can try meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or other relaxation techniques. You can also try to reduce your workload or take a break from work if possible.</p><h3>2. Improve Nutrition</h3><p>Poor nutrition can also contribute to hair loss and itchy scalp. Make sure you're eating a balanced diet that includes protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins A, C, and E. You can also take supplements to ensure you're getting enough of these nutrients.</p><h3>3. Use the Right Hair Products</h3><p>Using the wrong hair products can irritate your scalp and contribute to hair loss. Look for products that are gentle and free of harsh chemicals. Avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons too often, as they can damage your hair and scalp.</p><h3>4.
