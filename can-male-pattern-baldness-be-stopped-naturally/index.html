Use Natural Oils</h3><p>Massaging your scalp with natural oils such as coconut oil, olive oil, and castor oil can help stimulate hair growth and prevent hair loss.

Take Supplements</h3><p>Supplements such as biotin, vitamin D, and zinc can help promote hair growth and prevent hair loss. Biotin is essential for healthy hair, while vitamin D and zinc help regulate hormone levels in the body.</p><h3>3.
