Look no further, as we have compiled a list of the best mousse for wavy hair in 2020. With the right mousse, you can enhance your waves and achieve a natural, effortless look. Read on to discover our top picks and learn how to use them for optimal results.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Mousse is a popular styling product for wavy hair, as it adds volume, hold, and definition. It is a lightweight foam that can be applied to wet or dry hair, and it is easy to distribute evenly throughout your strands. Mousse works by coating each hair strand and creating a barrier against humidity, which can cause frizz and flyaways. It also enhances the natural texture of your hair, making it look fuller and bouncier.</p><h2>How to Use Mousse for Wavy Hair</h2><p>Before applying mousse, make sure your hair is clean and damp. You can either towel-dry your hair or use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair partially. Then, dispense a golf ball-sized amount of mousse into your palm and rub your hands together to distribute it evenly. Flip your head upside down and scrunch your hair from the ends to the roots, making sure to coat each strand. Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair on a low heat and speed setting, while scrunching your hair with your hands. Once your hair is completely dry, you can use a curling iron or wand to touch up any loose or frizzy waves.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. This will remove any buildup or residue from previous hair products and leave your hair clean and ready for styling.</p><h3>Step 2: Towel-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Gently towel-dry your hair to remove excess moisture. Do not rub your hair vigorously, as this can cause frizz and breakage.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Mousse</h3><p>Dispense a golf ball-sized amount of mousse into your palm and rub your hands together to distribute it evenly. Then, flip your head upside down and scrunch your hair from the ends to the roots, making sure to coat each strand.</p><h3>Step 4: Diffuse Your Hair</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair on a low heat and speed setting, while scrunching your hair with your hands. This will help enhance your waves and create volume.</p><h3>Step 5: Touch Up Your Waves</h3><p>If you have any loose or frizzy waves, you can use a curling iron or wand to touch them up. Simply wrap the sections of hair around the barrel and hold for a few seconds, then release.</p><h2>Tips for Using Mousse on Wavy Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your mousse:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Apply mousse to damp hair, as it will distribute more evenly than on dry hair.</li><li>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to enhance your waves and create volume.</li><li>Avoid touching your hair too much while it is drying, as this can cause frizz and disrupt the wave pattern.</li><li>Experiment with different amounts of mousse to find the right balance for your hair type and length.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Can I use mousse on dry hair?</h3><p>A: While it is best to use mousse on damp hair, you can use it on dry hair to refresh your waves or add some volume. Simply apply a small amount of mousse to your hands and scrunch your hair from the ends to the roots.</p><h3>Q: Will mousse make my hair crunchy?</h3><p>A: No, mousse should not make your hair crunchy if you use the right amount and distribute it evenly. If you do notice any crunchiness, you can scrunch your hair with your hands to soften it up.</p><h3>Q: How often should I use mousse on my hair?</h3><p>A: It depends on your hair type and styling routine. If you want to enhance your waves and create a natural, effortless look, you can use mousse every time you wash your hair. If you prefer a sleeker or smoother look, you can use mousse less frequently or switch to a different styling product.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips for Wavy Hair</h2><p>In addition to using the best mousse for wavy hair, there are some other tips you can follow to keep your waves looking their best:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it is dry, as this can cause frizz and disrupt the wave pattern.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when it is wet.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools on your hair too often, as this can damage your hair and cause breakage.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and other environmental factors by wearing a hat or using a leave-in conditioner with SPF.</li><li>Eat a balanced diet and stay hydrated to promote healthy hair growth and prevent dryness.</li></ul><p>With the right mousse and hair care routine, you can achieve beautiful, bouncy waves that last all day.
