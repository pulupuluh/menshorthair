However, with a little creativity, you can find a hairstyle that flatters your face shape and enhances your natural beauty.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Fine hair can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. On one hand, it’s easy to manage and style, but on the other hand, it can lack volume and body. If you have a square face, it means that your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all about the same width. This can give your face a strong, angular appearance.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you want to soften your facial features, you can try adding layers to your hair. Layers can add volume and movement to fine hair, and they can also create the illusion of a more oval-shaped face. You can also try a side-swept bang or a deep side part to draw attention away from your angular jawline.</p><h3>Step by Step</h3><p>Here are some steps to follow when choosing a hairstyle for a 60-year-old woman with fine hair and a square face:</p><ul><li>1. Consult with your hairstylist: They can recommend hairstyles that suit your face shape and hair type.</li><li>2.

Avoid blunt cuts: Blunt cuts can make your face appear even more angular.</li><li>2. Consider highlights: Highlights can add dimension and texture to fine hair.</li><li>3. Use volumizing products: Products like mousse, texturizing spray, and dry shampoo can all add volume to fine hair.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about hairstyles for a 60-year-old woman with fine hair and a square face:</p><h3>What hairstyles should I avoid if I have a square face?</h3><p>Avoid blunt cuts and straight bangs, as they can emphasize your angular features.</p><h3>Can I wear my hair long if I have a square face?</h3><p>Yes, you can wear your hair long if you have a square face, as long as it adds volume and movement.</p><h3>What is the best way to add volume to fine hair?</h3><p>You can add volume to fine hair by using volumizing products like mousse, texturizing spray, and dry shampoo.
