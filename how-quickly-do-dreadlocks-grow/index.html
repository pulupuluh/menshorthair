If you're starting with short hair, your dreadlocks may form more quickly than if you're starting with long hair.</p><h3>Maintenance</h3><p>Proper maintenance is key to ensuring your dreadlocks grow as quickly as possible. If you're not taking care of your hair properly, it could take longer for your dreadlocks to form.</p><h2 id="how-to-speed-up-dreadlock-growth">How to Speed Up Dreadlock Growth</h2><p>While you can't make your hair grow faster, there are some things you can do to help speed up the dreadlocking process:</p><h3>Keep Your Hair Clean</h3><p>Keeping your hair clean is essential to promoting healthy hair growth.
