Short hairstyles were all the rage during this time, with women opting for cropped cuts that were easy to maintain and style. In this guide, we'll show you how to recreate the iconic 1950's look on short hair, from the classic bob to the pixie cut.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 1950's was a decade of glamour, with women's fashion and beauty taking center stage. Short haircuts were particularly popular during this time, with women opting for sleek and sophisticated styles that were easy to maintain. The classic bob was a staple, with variations such as the inverted bob and the pageboy becoming popular as well. The pixie cut also emerged as a popular option, with stars like Audrey Hepburn and Mia Farrow sporting the iconic style.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>To achieve the 1950's look on short hair, you'll need to start with a good cut. Whether you opt for a classic bob or a pixie cut, make sure your hair is cut to the right length and shape for your face. Once you have the right cut, follow these steps to style your hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep your hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are suitable for your hair type. Towel dry your hair gently, then apply a heat protectant product to prevent damage from heat styling.</p><h3>Step 2: Blow dry your hair</h3><p>Using a round brush, blow dry your hair in sections, starting from the roots and working your way down. Use the brush to create volume and lift at the crown, and smooth out any frizz or flyaways.</p><h3>Step 3: Curl or straighten your hair</h3><p>Depending on the style you're going for, you can either curl or straighten your hair at this point. For a classic bob, use a curling iron to create soft curls or waves. For a pixie cut, use a flat iron to straighten your hair and create a sleek, polished look.</p><h3>Step 4: Add the finishing touches</h3><p>To finish off your 1950's look, use a styling product such as hairspray or pomade to hold your hair in place. You can also add accessories such as headbands, scarves or hair clips to complete the retro vibe.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Choose a hairstyle that suits your face shape and hair type</li><li>Invest in good quality hair products and tools</li><li>Experiment with different styling techniques to find what works best for you</li><li>Accessorize your hair with retro-inspired headbands, scarves or clips</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What kind of products should I use to style my short hair in a 1950's look?</h3><p>You'll need a good quality shampoo and conditioner suitable for your hair type, as well as a heat protectant product, styling product such as hairspray or pomade, and a round brush or flat iron depending on the style you're going for.</p><h3>Can I recreate a 1950's look on very short hair?</h3><p>Absolutely! The pixie cut was a popular style during the 1950's, and you can easily recreate the look with a good cut and some styling products.</p><h3>What kind of accessories should I use to complete my 1950's look?</h3><p>Headbands, scarves, and hair clips were all popular accessories during the 1950's. Look for retro-inspired pieces that will complement your hairstyle and outfit.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your short hair looking its best, make sure to wash and condition it regularly with products that are suitable for your hair type. Avoid using too much heat when styling your hair, and use a heat protectant product to prevent damage. Trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to keep it looking healthy and prevent split ends.</p><p>Now that you know how to style short hair in a 1950's look, it's time to channel your inner retro goddess and rock that vintage glam!</p></article>
