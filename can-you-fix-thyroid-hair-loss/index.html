When your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones, it can lead to hair loss, among other symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and depression. This condition is called hypothyroidism.</p><p>On the other hand, an overactive thyroid gland can also lead to hair loss. This condition is called hyperthyroidism. In this case, the thyroid gland produces too much hormone, which speeds up your metabolism, causing hair loss.</p><h2>2.

If you suspect you have a thyroid issue, it's essential to see a doctor who can diagnose and treat your condition.
