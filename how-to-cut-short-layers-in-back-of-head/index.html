Short layers in the back of your head can give your hair a fresh and modern look. But, going to a salon can be expensive, and not everybody has the time or money to do so. That’s why we’ve created this step-by-step guide on how to cut short layers in the back of your head at home. </p><h2> Description </h2><p>Short layers in the back of the head are created by cutting the hair at different lengths, which adds volume and texture. This technique is perfect for those who have thin or fine hair as it can give the illusion of thicker hair. </p><h2> How to Cut Short Layers in Back of Head </h2><p>Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools: </p><ul><li>Sharp scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Hair clips</li></ul><p>Now, let’s get started! </p><h3> Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair </h3><p>Start by washing and drying your hair. If possible, let your hair air dry as it’s easier to cut when it’s not wet. </p><h3> Step 2: Part Your Hair </h3><p>Using the comb, part your hair in the middle or on the side, depending on your preference. </p><h3> Step 3: Section Your Hair </h3><p>Clip the front section of your hair away from the back section. This will make it easier to cut the back of your hair. </p><h3> Step 4: Cut the First Layer </h3><p>Starting from the back, take a small section of hair and hold it between your fingers. Cut the hair at an angle, starting from the bottom and working your way up. </p><p>Remember to cut only a small section of hair at a time, as it’s easier to adjust the length if needed. </p><h3> Step 5: Repeat the Process </h3><p>Move to the next section of hair and repeat the process. Remember to cut at an angle to create layers. </p><h3> Step 6: Check Your Progress </h3><p>After cutting a few layers, check your progress in the mirror. If you’re happy with the length and volume, continue cutting. </p><h3> Step 7: Cut the Front Layers </h3><p>Once you’ve finished cutting the back layers, unclip the front section of your hair. Take a small section of hair from the front and cut it at an angle, starting from the bottom and working your way up. </p><p>Repeat this process for the rest of the front layers. </p><h3> Step 8: Blend the Layers </h3><p>After cutting all the layers, use the comb to blend the layers together. This will give your hair a natural and seamless look. </p><h3> Step 9: Style Your Hair </h3><p>Now that you’ve cut your hair, it’s time to style it. You can use a curling iron or straightener to add some waves or keep it straight. </p><h2> Tips </h2><ul><li>Start by cutting less hair than you think you need. You can always cut more if needed. </li><li>Use sharp scissors to avoid split ends. </li><li>Don’t cut your hair when it’s wet as it can shrink when it dries. </li><li>Take your time and be patient. </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> Can I cut my hair if it’s curly? </h3><p>Yes, you can cut your hair if it’s curly. However, keep in mind that curly hair tends to shrink when it’s dry, so cut less hair than you think you need. </p><h3> Do I need to use a specific type of scissors? </h3><p>It’s recommended to use hair cutting scissors, as they’re sharper and more precise. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p>After cutting your hair, it’s important to take care of it. Use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and moisturized. Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as it can damage it. </p><p>Congratulations! You’ve now learned how to cut short layers in the back of your head. With a little bit of practice, you’ll be able to create a salon-worthy hairstyle at home. </p></article>
