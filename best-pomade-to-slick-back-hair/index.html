It can be used to achieve a variety of styles, including slicked back hair. The best pomades for this style are those that provide a strong hold without making the hair look greasy or weighed down. These pomades typically have a water-based formula, which makes them easier to wash out than oil-based pomades.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Slick Back Hair</h2><p>Slicked back hair is a classic style that has been popular for decades. To achieve this look, you'll need to have hair that is at least 2-3 inches long on top. Here's how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a good quality shampoo and conditioner. This will help to remove any dirt, oil, or product buildup from your hair. Once you've washed your hair, towel dry it to remove any excess moisture.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply pomade</h3><p>Take a small amount of pomade (about the size of a dime) and rub it between your palms to warm it up. Then, apply it evenly to your hair, starting at the back and working your way forward. Be sure to distribute the pomade evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Comb your hair</h3><p>Using a fine-toothed comb, comb your hair straight back from your forehead. Make sure to comb your hair all the way to the back of your head to create a smooth, even look. You can also use your fingers to smooth out any bumps or flyaways.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish the look</h3><p>Once you've combed your hair back, you can either leave it as is or style it further. You can add a side part or a quiff to create a more modern look, or you can leave it slicked back for a classic look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide to slicking back your hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the right pomade</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the best pomades for slicked back hair are those that provide a strong hold without making your hair look greasy. Look for pomades with a water-based formula, as these are easier to wash out and won't leave any residue in your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Towel dry your hair to remove any excess moisture, but don't blow dry it completely. You want some moisture in your hair to help the pomade spread evenly.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply the pomade</h3><p>Take a small amount of pomade (about the size of a dime) and rub it between your palms to warm it up. Then, apply it evenly to your hair, starting at the back and working your way forward. Use your fingers to distribute the pomade evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Comb your hair</h3><p>Using a fine-toothed comb, comb your hair straight back from your forehead.
