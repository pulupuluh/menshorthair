Look for pictures of short sides long top haircuts that you like and bring them with you to the salon or barber.

This will make it easier to see the natural texture and shape of your hair, which will help you achieve a more even cut.</p><h2 id="tools">Tools Needed</h2><p>To cut a short sides long top style, you'll need a few basic tools:</p><ul><li>Scissors: A good pair of scissors is essential for any haircut. Look for scissors that are specifically designed for cutting hair, as they will be sharper and more precise.</li><li>Clippers: Clippers are used to create the short sides of the haircut. Look for clippers with adjustable blades, so you can vary the length of the cut.</li><li>Comb: A comb is used to separate sections of hair and create a clean, even part.</li><li>Hair Gel or Wax: These products help to define the hair and keep it in place.</li></ul><h2 id="cutting">Cutting Techniques</h2><p>The key to a successful short sides long top cut is to create a sharp contrast between the short sides and the long top. Here's how to do it:</p><ol><li>Start by using the clippers to create a short, even cut on the sides and back of the head. You can vary the length depending on your preference, but a #1 or #2 guard is a good starting point.</li><li>Next, use the scissors to cut the hair on top of the head. This should be done in sections, starting at the front and working your way back. Use the comb to create a clean, even part and then cut the hair to your desired length.</li><li>Blend the sides and top together by using the scissors to create a gradual transition between the two lengths. This should be done with short, quick snips, taking care not to cut too much hair at once.</li><li>Finally, use hair gel or wax to define the style and keep it in place. Apply a small amount to your fingertips and work it through the hair, starting at the front and working your way back.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for a Great Cut</h2><p>Here are a few additional tips to help you achieve the perfect short sides long top haircut:</p><ul><li>Be patient: Cutting hair takes time, so don't rush the process. Take your time and work in small sections to ensure an even cut.</li><li>Communicate with your stylist: Make sure you're clear about the style you want to achieve and ask your stylist for their advice on what will work best for your hair type and face shape.</li><li>Practice good hair care: Regular trims and proper hair care will help to keep your short sides long top cut looking sharp and fresh. Use a quality shampoo and conditioner and avoid over-styling with heat tools.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><p>Here are some common questions about short sides long top haircuts:</p><h3>1.
