On average, people lose between 50-100 hairs per day, which is completely normal. However, if you're losing more than that, it's important to take steps to address the issue. Here are some tips to help you stop worrying about hair fall:</p><h3>1. Identify the Cause of Your Hair Fall</h3><p>The first step in addressing hair fall is to identify the cause.
