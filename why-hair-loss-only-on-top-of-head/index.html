It is a genetic condition that affects the hair follicles located on the scalp's top part. </p><p>Androgenetic alopecia is more common in men, but women can also experience it. The condition is caused by the male hormone Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which shrinks hair follicles, making them unable to produce healthy hair.
