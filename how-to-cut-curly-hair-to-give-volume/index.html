Layers create movement and volume, which will give your curls the bounce they need. When cutting curly hair, it's important to start with dry hair. This will allow you to see the natural shape of your curls and ensure that you don't cut too much off. Follow these steps to cut curly hair to give volume:</p><h3>Step 1: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using clips or hair ties. Start by dividing your hair into four sections: front right, front left, back right, and back left. Secure each section with a clip or hair tie.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Bottom Layer</h3><p>Start with the bottom layer of your hair. Take a small section of hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it straight across. Repeat this step for the entire bottom layer of your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Middle Layer</h3><p>Release the next layer of hair and repeat the same process. Comb the hair straight down, hold it between your fingers, and cut it straight across. This layer should be shorter than the bottom layer, creating a graduated effect.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top Layer</h3><p>Release the top layer of your hair and repeat the same process as the previous steps. This layer should be the shortest and create the most volume.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to cutting curly hair to give volume:</p><ol><li>Section your hair into four sections: front right, front left, back right, and back left.</li><li>Cut the bottom layer of your hair straight across.</li><li>Release the middle layer of your hair and cut it shorter than the bottom layer.</li><li>Release the top layer of your hair and cut it the shortest to create the most volume.</li><li>Blend the layers by cutting into them with scissors at a 45-degree angle.</li><li>Trim any uneven or split ends.</li><li>Style your hair as desired.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use sharp scissors to prevent split ends.</li><li>Start with dry hair to see the natural shape of your curls.</li><li>Don't cut too much off at once.
