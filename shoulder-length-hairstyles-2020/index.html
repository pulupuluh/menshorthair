Whether you're looking for something classic or trendy, we've got you covered. From how to style your hair to tips for maintaining it, we'll cover everything you need to know to keep your locks looking fabulous. So, let's dive in!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Shoulder length hairstyles have been a popular choice for women for years, and 2020 is no exception. This versatile length allows for a variety of styles, from beachy waves to sleek bobs. It's the perfect compromise between short and long hair, making it ideal for those who want a change without committing to a drastic chop.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're considering a shoulder length hairstyle, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, consider your face shape and hair texture. Shoulder length hair suits most face shapes, but if you have a round face, you may want to avoid blunt cuts that add volume to the sides of your face. If you have fine hair, a layered cut can add volume and movement.</p><p>Next, think about your lifestyle and how much time you're willing to spend on your hair. Shoulder length hair can be low-maintenance or high-maintenance, depending on the style you choose. If you want something that requires minimal styling, opt for a textured cut that can be air-dried. If you're willing to put in more effort, a sleek bob or loose waves can be achieved with a curling iron or straightener.</p><h2>Step by step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving a simple shoulder-length hairstyle:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair</li><li>Section off your hair into layers</li><li>Using a curling iron or straightener, style each layer</li><li>Finish with a light hairspray or texturizing spray to add volume and hold</li></ol><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are a few tips for maintaining your shoulder length hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to prevent split ends</li><li>Use a heat protectant when using hot tools</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as it can weigh down your hair</li><li>Experiment with different partings to change up your look</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about shoulder length hairstyles:</p><h3>What face shape suits shoulder length hair?</h3><p>Shoulder length hair suits most face shapes, but if you have a round face, you may want to avoid blunt cuts that add volume to the sides of your face.
