This is determined by genetics and the amount of testosterone your body produces. Some men are blessed with thick, luscious beards while others may only be able to grow thin mustaches. Additionally, age can also affect the thickness of your facial hair. As you get older, your hair may become thinner and more brittle, which can make it more difficult to grow a thick beard.</p><h2 id="how-to-grow-a-thicker-beard">How to Grow a Thicker Beard</h2><p>If you're looking to grow a thicker beard, there are a few things you can do to promote healthy hair growth.
